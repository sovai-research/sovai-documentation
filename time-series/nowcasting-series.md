# Nowcasting Series

`Tutorials` are the best documentation â€” [<mark style="color:blue;">`Nowcasting Series Tutorial`</mark>](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sovai-research/sovai-public/blob/main/notebooks/computational/Nowcasting%20Notebook.ipynb)

## Nowcasting Module

This module demonstrates how to use the `sovai` library for nowcasting financial data, particularly focusing on accounting data for mega-cap stocks.

### Setup

First, import and authenticate with the `sovai` library:

### Nowcasting

#### For a Specific Stock

To perform nowcasting for a particular stock (e.g., AAPL) and a specific accounting metric (e.g., accounts receivable):

```python
df_accounting.query("ticker == 'AAPL'").nowcast("data", "accounts_receivable")
```

#### For All Stocks

To perform nowcasting for all stocks in the dataset:

```python
df_accounting.nowcast("data", "accounts_receivable")
```

### Visualization

To create a plot of the nowcasted data:

```python
df_accounting.nowcast("plot")
```

### Notes

* The `sovai` library provides methods for data retrieval, stock selection, and nowcasting.
* The `nowcast` method can be used with "data" parameter to return nowcasted data, or "plot" to generate a visualization.
* Make sure you have the necessary permissions and a valid token to access the `sovai` library and its data.

This notebook demonstrates a streamlined approach to nowcasting financial data using the `sovai` library, allowing for quick analysis of accounting metrics for mega-cap stocks.
