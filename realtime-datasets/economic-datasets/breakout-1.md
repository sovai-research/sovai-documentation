### Computations

#### Custom Aggregates

We can use the inputs to come up with new aggregartes of the original input data, doing that we can come up with new indices. Here I have come up with a few new ones.&#x20;

```python
df_risks_agg = sov.compute('risk-aggregates', df=df_risks)
```

## Risk Database Description

### Overview

The Risk Database is a sophisticated analytical tool designed to evaluate and forecast a wide range of risks across different sectors of the economy and financial markets. Utilizing an extensive collection of time-series data, the database aids investors in navigating the complex landscape of market, business, and political risks.

#### Potential Use Cases

1. **Strategic Investment Decisions**: Investors can use the database to understand the impact of various risks on asset classes, thereby tailoring their investment strategies to mitigate potential downsides or capitalize on emerging opportunities.

3. **Economic Analysis**: Policymakers and economic analysts can leverage the insights to gauge economic health and prepare for potential market shifts caused by political or business developments.

### Key Components

#### Risk Indices

1. **Turing Risk Index**: A composite measure combining Market, Business, and Political Risks to provide an overarching view of the risk environment.
2. **Market Risk Score**: Evaluates the potential volatility and the downside risk within global markets using advanced statistical models.
3. **Business Risk Score**: Aggregates various measures of business conditions, sector sentiment, and economic indicators.
4. **Political Risk Score**: Measures the level of uncertainty in domestic and international policy-making spheres.
