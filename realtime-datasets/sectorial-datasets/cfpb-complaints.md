# Clinical Trials

Data is updated weekly on Fridays as is made available from regulatory filers

## Description

We predict the success of a clinical trial, its duration, and the expected economic impact using state-of-the-art machine learning models. Our solution leverages deep learning encoders and language models applied to regulatory filings and biochemical data. The dataset includes detailed metadata about each trial alongside predictions for regulatory phase success and/or approval rate.

This allows users to screen opportunities and anticipate outcomes with greater accuracy.

## Data Access

```python
import sovai as sov
# Ensure authentication is done if needed
# sov.token_auth(token="YOUR_TOKEN")

# Access clinical trial data including predictions
df_clinical = sov.data("clinical/trials", verbose=True, source="listed")
df_clinical.tail() # Display the last few rows
```

### Accessing Specific Tickers

You can also retrieve data for specific tickers. For example:

```python
import sovai as sov
# Note: The endpoint might vary slightly depending on API structure,
# using "clinical/trials" based on notebook examples.
# Adjust if "trials/predict" is specifically needed for ticker filtering.
df_pfizer = sov.data("clinical/trials", tickers=["PFE"], source="listed")
```

4.  **Portfolio Management**: Assess the risk profile of a portfolio of clinical trials based on predicted outcomes.
5.  **Resource Allocation**: Prioritize resources towards trials with higher predicted success rates or shorter predicted durations.
6.  **Benchmarking**: Compare the predicted success rates of a company's trials against industry averages or competitors.
7.  **Market Entry Timing**: Estimate potential drug approval timelines based on predicted trial durations and success.
8.  **Identifying Undervalued Assets**: Find trials with high predicted success but potentially overlooked by the market.
9.  **Academic Research**: Study factors influencing clinical trial success using the provided predictions and metadata.
10. **Risk Mitigation**: Identify trials with low predicted success for early de-risking or partnership opportunities.
