## Description

This dataset provides detailed information on patent applications and grants filed by or assigned to publicly traded companies, mapped to their respective ticker symbols. It includes textual data like titles, abstracts, descriptions, and claims, alongside metadata such as filing/grant dates, classifications (IPC, NAICS), and application/grant IDs.

This data enables analysis of corporate innovation, R&D activity, technological focus, competitive intelligence, and potential intellectual property value across different companies and sectors.

## Data Access

```python
import sovai as sov
# Ensure authentication is done if needed
# sov.token_auth(token="YOUR_TOKEN")

# Access Patent Applications
df_apps = sov.data("patents/applications", tickers=["AAPL", "AMZN"]) # Example tickers

# Access Patent Grants
df_grants = sov.data("patents/grants", tickers=["AAPL", "AMZN"]) # Example tickers
```

### Accessing Specific Tickers and Dates

You can retrieve data for specific tickers and define date ranges:

```python
# Applications for specific tickers from a start date
df_specific_apps = sov.data("patents/applications",
                            tickers=["000066.SZ", "AMZN", "AAPL"],
                            start_date="2014-11-20") # Example from notebook

# Grants for a specific ticker from a start date
df_specific_grants = sov.data("patents/grants",
                             tickers=["AMZN"],
                             start_date="2014-11-20") # Example from notebook
```
