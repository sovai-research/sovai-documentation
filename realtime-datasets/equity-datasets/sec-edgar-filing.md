# SEC Edgar Filing

`Tutorials` are the best documentation â€” [<mark style="color:blue;">`Edgar Filings Tutorial`</mark>](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sovai-research/sovai-public/blob/main/notebooks/studies/Edgar%20Tools.ipynb)

#### SEC Search

To search for SEC filings:

```python
import sovai as sov
sov.sec_search("CFO Resignation")
```

This function searches for filings related to the given keyword and saves the results in a CSV file. It is the fastest way to go from search query to CSV/datframe output.&#x20;

* Available search parameters:
  * Search Keyword
  * CIK (Central Index Key)
  * Filing Type
  * Date Range (Start Date, End Date)
  * Company Name
  * Ticker Symbol
* Search and Download buttons functionality

#### Loading Search Results

After performing a search, you can load the results into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("edgar_search_results/search_for_file_name.csv")
```

#### Accessing Specific Filings

```python
nflx_filing = sov.sec_filing("NFLX", "10-Q", "2022-06-06")
```

This creates a filing object for nflx Inc.'s 10-Q filing dated June 6, 2022.

#### Displays the full report

The filing object provides several attributes and methods for analysis:

```
nflx_filing.report
```
