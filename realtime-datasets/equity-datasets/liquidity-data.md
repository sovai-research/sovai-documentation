## Liquidity Datasets Documentation

Two datasets that can help with understanding the liquidity dynamics for equities.&#x20;

***

### Price Improvement Dataset

The Price Improvement dataset provides information on price improvements for various stocks, offering insights into trading execution quality.

```python
import sovai as sov
df_improve = sov.data("liquidity/price_improvement")
```

### Market Opportunity Dataset

The Market Opportunity dataset offers information on market making opportunities and liquidity provision for different stocks.

```python
df_market = sov.data("liquidity/market_opportunity")
```

### Accessing Specific Tickers

You can also retrieve data for specific tickers across these datasets. For example:

```python
df_ticker_imp = sov.data("liquidity/price_improvement", tickers=["AAPL", "MSFT"])
df_ticker_opp = sov.data("liquidity/market_opportunity", tickers=["AAPL", "MSFT"])
```
