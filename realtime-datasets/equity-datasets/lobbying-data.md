## Lobbying Dataset&#x20;

This section covers the usage of the lobbying dataset. The dataset can be accessed using the sov.data function from our data library.

### Lobbying Dataset

The Lobbying dataset provides detailed information on lobbying activities, including client information, spending, and lobbying issues for various companies.

<pre class="language-python"><code class="lang-python"><strong>import sovai as sov
</strong><strong>df_lobbying = sov.data("lobbying/public")
</strong></code></pre>

### Accessing Specific Tickers

You can also retrieve data for specific tickers. For example:

```python
df_ticker_lobbying = sov.data("lobbying/public", tickers=["WFC", "EXPGY"])
```

This documentation provides a clear guide on how to access the dataset, and can be easily extended or modified as needed for additional details.
