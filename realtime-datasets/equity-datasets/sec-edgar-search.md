# SEC Edgar Search

`Tutorials` are the best documentation â€” [<mark style="color:blue;">`Edgar Filings Tutorial`</mark>](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sovai-research/sovai-public/blob/main/notebooks/studies/Edgar%20Tools.ipynb)

## Description

This documentation outlines tools for accessing and analyzing SEC EDGAR filings data. It provides functions to search for specific filings, retrieve filing documents, extract financial statements, and visualize key financial facts.

The toolkit enables users to efficiently gather and analyze regulatory filing data for various companies, supporting in-depth financial analysis and research.

## Data Access

#### SEC Search

To search for SEC filings:

```python
import sovai as sov
sov.sec_search("CFO Resignation")
```

This function searches for filings related to the given keyword and saves the results in a CSV file. It is the fastest way to go from search query to CSV/datframe output.

* Available search parameters:
  * Search Keyword
  * CIK (Central Index Key)
  * Filing Type
  * Date Range (Start Date, End Date)
  * Company Name
  * Ticker Symbol
* Search and Download buttons functionality

#### Loading Search Results

After performing a search, you can load the results into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("edgar_search_results/search_for_file_name.csv")
```

#### Accessing Specific Filings

```python
nflx_filing = sov.sec_filing("NFLX", "10-Q", "2022-06-06")
```

This creates a filing object for nflx Inc.'s 10-Q filing dated June 6, 2022.

#### Displays the full report

The filing object provides several attributes and methods for analysis:

```
nflx_filing.report
```
