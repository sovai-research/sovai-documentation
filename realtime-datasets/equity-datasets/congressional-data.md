## Description

The Congressional Trading dataset offers comprehensive insights into the financial transactions of U.S. Congress members, encompassing both Senate and House representatives. This dataset includes detailed information on securities traded, transaction dates, types of transactions (e.g., purchases, sales), transaction amounts, political party affiliations, and pertinent biographical details of each legislator.&#x20;

By providing transparency into the investment activities of elected officials, this data serves as a crucial tool for constituents, analysts, investors, and policymakers to monitor potential conflicts of interest, assess ethical compliance, and understand the financial behaviors of those in power.

## Data Access

The easiest is to just download the dump and to filter data from there, this is updated on a daily basis.

```python
from sovai import sov
df_congress = sov.data("congress")
```
