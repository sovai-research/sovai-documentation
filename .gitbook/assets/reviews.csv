If you like the clean lines of modern architecture, a full view of a walk out garden, big city sites. beaches for swimming, trails for walking and endless shopping all within minutes this is the place for you . The birds singing will greet your day and the quite surroundings act as a perfect relaxing environment after a day of business or sight seeing.
<br/>Pam and John are perfect hosts ready to assist you when and if you choose."
58506,241897955,2022-02-08,3159702,Christine,"Great place to stay with kids if you are not always out and about but is also looking for a place where you can just chill on a  good day. There is an excellent playground up the road (5 min walk) and bus 423 will take you to the city in 20 min (only run once every hour so make sure you plan). John was very friendly, quick to reply and helpful in any way!"
58506,239705627,2022-02-08,153055762,Fahad,"We stayed at Studio Yindi with our two children for a complete month. It has a comfortable environment in a beautiful setting, an intelligent design to accommodate up to 4 people and all necessary arrangements to help you settle-in quickly. We found the public transport reasonably accessible as well. John and Pam's hospitality was exceptional. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this place... highly recommended!"
58506,230746697,2022-02-08,156694231,Stephanie,Lovely place and great location!  John met us as we arrived and showed us around.  I loved our backyard bird visitors!
58506,230059852,2022-02-08,148184643,Felicity,John's villa was perfect for our family's short stay in Sydney. The location was amazing and close to Balmoral beach which our children enjoyed.  John was accomodating and did what he could to make us feel welcome. We would love to stay here again. 5 stars!
58506,229096464,2022-02-08,60828871,Vivek,"Johns place is located in an affluent harbourside suburb with so many boutiques cafes and bistros along Military Road. My family really enjoyed their stay at this accommodation. <br/><br/>It has great ferry and bus connectivity to the city and John on the first day , drove me around Mosman to show me local grocery stores and places where I could buy basic amenities for my stay."
58506,228052852,2022-02-08,44445208,Christophe,"Le studio est dans un quartier calme de Mosman, à 20mn en bus du centre de Sydney. Un bus passe dans le rue au dessus toutes les heures. On peut aussi rejoindre la ville par le ferry en rejoignant Mosman bay en 10mn en voiture.<br/>Le studio est lumineux grâce à ses grandes baies vitrées.<br/>Il est équipé de deux pièces attenantes, une salle d'eau avec douche et WC et une petite chambres avec un lit double.<br/>Dans le studio, il y a un coin aménagé pour deux lits simples. Ce coin est isolé du reste du studio par quelques meubles bas. Il manque un rideau pour obscurcir cet espace de nuit.<br/>Le salon est vaste et agréable.  On y trouve deux canapés, quelques rangements et une télé.<br/>La cuisine est équipée de deux plaques électriques, un micro ondes et un grill pain. on trouve aussi une machine à laver récente. Il est facile d'étendre son linge. Les couverts et les verres sont en nombre limité. Les accessoires et ustensile de cuisine sont nombreux.<br/>John est un homme présent, aimable et serviable. Il est aussi de bons conseils. Nous avons apprécié notre séjour dans le studio."
58506,226474452,2022-02-08,33360953,Nicolas,Super studio idéalement situé. À 20 minutes de la cbd en bus. John est très sympathique. Il nous a conduit au supermarché le jour de notre arrivée. Il nous a ensuite prodigué de nombreux conseils.
58506,225236101,2022-02-08,37898620,Adeline,"Appartement spacieux dans quartier résidentiel chic. Bus à 2 min à pied, qui dessert directement le CBD. Supermarchés proches également. Petit jardin, bouteille de vin en arrivant, wifi, cuisine, nous avons réellement apprécié cette semaine passee chez John. Il'a été très réactif et super accueil. Nous recommandons à 100%"

58506,218615311,2022-02-08,26151644,Kelley,"John was a great host. Quick to respond. In the studio was lots of maps, information about buses etc. This was handy to have. <br/>We were travelling with our 2 children and this studio was perfect for us. Easy walking distance to the buses to the city. Was lovely to come back to somewhere peaceful in the evenings. John was great and gave us a lift to the ferry in mosman bay to get to circular quay. If you get a chance go to balmoral beach for the fish and chips. It is a 30 minute walk from the studio (the walk back is tough as up a huge hill). <br/>The studio was equipped with everything we needed. Would definitely recommend."
58506,216455534,2022-02-08,77437521,Ian,"Fantastic location, great sIze, very welcoming host. Thanks for a great time, John! Ian and Di"
58506,215298521,2022-02-08,156210173,Leon,John is a very friendly helpful host. Very quick with email replies. The property was ideal for whatbwe needed it for. The only slight downside is the transport into the City from the area. Which isn't anything to do with the property.

58506,349614861,2022-02-08,2767268,Sarah,We had a great stay at John and Pam’s home. The house had a light and modern fresh feel to it yet it was perfect and very comfortable for our young family. John and Pam were both more than willing to give us help and suggestions of what to do and how to get where we wanted to go. We really enjoyed our stay and hope we can come again!

58506,345743535,2022-02-08,89839396,Sébastien,"John's appartement is perfect for a family or a couple in a very calm place of Sydney. You can easily travel with the bus from there to the different interesting points around. John is a really good host, he helped us the first day for the bus and gave us useful information about Sydney. For sure I'll take another time this appartement if I come again in Sydney."
58506,341821469,2022-02-08,30510205,Emma,"Very limited kitchen by Australian standards,  no oven and only a bar fridge. Ok for a night or 2 but an extended stay with a family would be difficult."
58506,338546278,2022-02-08,208031064,Abhishek,Awesome host. guided us for things to do or not/places to visit.<br/>A perfect home for long or short term stay... Perfect place to stay- put if you have ur own vehicle... however place is well connected by govt buses.
58506,336065918,2022-02-08,8310825,Angela,During my stay I needed to decorate a cake and all the amenities in the kitchen were all available. Good heating and comfortable beds.
58506,333129970,2022-02-08,110724018,Natalie,"John’s place is comfortable and has everything you need- a home away from home. We travelled with 3 young children and we found the accommodation perfect for our needs. <br/><br/>John and Pam respected our privacy however were friendly, hospitable and provided great tips for things to do around Sydney with young children (on a couple of very wet Sydney days). The little backyard area was just gorgeous and the children loved exploring. <br/><br/>So close to public transport, supermarket and of course to the City centre. <br/><br/>We’d highly recommend John’s place to a family with children who are looking for a base for a Sydney getaway."
58506,331170609,2022-02-08,28030119,James,John is very affable and informative. It is a brilliant location.

58506,280279609,2022-02-08,166619087,Natasha,"Pam and John are excellent hosts.  We came from the UK and John was there to meet us and get us settled in. They checked up on us every so often to make sure we were okay and needed anything.<br/>The space is homely. Its not a sparkly shiny hotel, but a lived in studio apartment.  It has the amenities you need - Kettle, fridge, washing machine, basic cooking supplies, beds, shelves, sofa etc. We stayed for 5 weeks with no  issues. There is a nice backgarden for the summer time. The location is outside of the city center - it is a 15 minutes bus ride to the city from the bus stop at the top of the road. <br/>We would recommend this studio :)"
58506,264472305,2022-02-08,64820994,Vivian,thanks for john and Pamela's.these 2 beautiful days will keep in my mind for a lonnnnng time: the beautiful fireworks we watch in your sofa，the beautiful green views out of the living room，the small paths beside your house，and the two lovely people:the accommodating gentleman and the elegant lady.<br/>i will give a 5star recommend on this journey~ you can drive to city center injust15 minutes ，or by bus is also very convenient. it's quite and beautiful and safe. i love here， you will also^_^
58506,257632285,2022-02-08,80906390,Vicki,Fabulous apartment in a great area. Easy to get the bus into Sydney and great range of shops nearby. <br/>Pam and John were fabulous hosts giving us lots of local tips and even a couple of lifts which made life very easy! <br/>Would definitely recommend.

58506,247257519,2022-02-08,14745445,Peter,"John provided really good communication prior to our arrival, so there were no problems when we did arrive. We were only in Sydney for a couple of days to catch up with friends who were also in town, so we did not spend a lot of time in Studio Yindi. The accommodation was all that it said it was and it had everything that was needed."
58506,213398437,2022-02-08,101187704,Georgina,Very happy with our stay. John was helpful.  Our kids loved all the wildlife in the garden.
58506,206749195,2022-02-08,53927343,Sandra,"Gorgeous, light space and the greatest hospitality a young family could wish for. So kid-friendly! Also fantastic neighborhood which was easily discovered thanks to all the great tips and support John and Pamela gave us. Amazing people!"

58506,130146950,2022-02-08,100798656,수영,The host is very kind. <br/>one episode. we had to arrive home at 10 pm. He gave us a ride to the nearest store so we could buy some food.
58506,126872370,2022-02-08,62415129,Mary Grace,A lovely basic accommodation Great  helpful hosts Need car as ground is hilly  <br/>There are frequent buses to city and elsewhere but mostly you have to walk uphill to Military road If using a car there is no problem Within easy reach of city and beaches too!
58506,122761184,2022-02-08,91404330,Кристина,"I would like to say thanks for John and for him worrying about our staying in the apartment. Everything was clean and ready then we arrived. Thank you for good communication and explaining of all details in public transportation, locations, great places for visiting in Sydney."
58506,121941574,2022-02-08,10710557,Kali,"John and Pam were very welcoming and helpful in suggesting activities when the weather wasn't what we expected. I especially appreciated the loan of rain gear and warmer clothes. There are buses nearby, though not as frequent as we would have liked.
<br/>The studio was well appointed with everything we needed for our stay. And the beds were comfortable."
58506,120799646,2022-02-08,23431798,Hanzi,"John and Pan are very nice, my family and me all felt  warm welcomed. Studio Yindi locates in a quiet and safe neighborhood. It is highly recommended."
58506,116085671,2022-02-08,91771443,Carol,"John was very welcoming and a has wonderful local knowledge.  The apartment is very comfortable, private and quiet, with a lovely garden and outdoor seating to enjoy. It is quite an exclusive area of Sydney, but could be difficult without a car.
<br/>We would love to return and have time to do more of the harbour walks in the area."
58506,115449264,2022-02-08,50842522,Liane,John was a fantastic host. The apartment is in a quiet street but still very central. The photos are definitely representative of the apartment which is quite roomy and has everything you need for a short stay. Thanks John! 
58506,114641436,2022-02-08,96523598,Damienn,"We loved this place. My wife, kids and I had a great time here and were pleasantly surprised with how beautiful the lush the outlook was from the studio. We fell in love with the Mosman area which was also a surprise.

58506,112748017,2022-02-08,19304678,Haley,John was very welcoming and accommodated our late arrival. The place was perfect for what we required and although our stay was short Studio Yindi made it so relaxing when we were able to spend time there. Would love to stay again. 
58506,111829657,2022-02-08,70108666,Mirkka,"John's place was a good place for checking out the city. Busses run close by, and the modest apartment has everything you could need. "
58506,110903681,2022-02-08,76710782,Evelyne,"Notre hôte a été très accueillant, il nous a donné plein de bons conseils et de bonnes adresses pour manger
<br/>À notre arrivée il nous a emmené en voiture pour nous montrer oú faire nos courses et comment se déplacer depuis chez lui
<br/>La maison est situé dans un quartier charmant de Sydney, vallonné et donnant sur une des nombreuses baies
<br/>Le studio est confortable et simple, les transports en commun sont rapidement accessibles mais attention ça monte !
<br/>Les propriétaires habitent à l'étage de la maison et le studio est situé sous leur terrasse qui est très grande.
<br/>Tout ce qu'il faut pour visiter en 4 jours Sydney 
<br/>Merci encore à John pour sa gentillesse et son accueil"
58506,109995876,2022-02-08,99284963,Lisa,"Lovely, no fuss, clean, quiet accommodation over-looking a glorious sunlit garden. The bus to the city is 50metres and only a short 15min trip to the city. John provided helpful travel tips and was very easy to communicate with."
58506,136018508,2022-02-08,26229742,Brooke,"We enjoyed our stay at Johns.  This is good accommodation, especially if there is 4 of you, keeping in mind there is 2 single bunk beds & a double bed.  Being surrounded by garden was lovely & we felt safe being there.<br/>Thank you "
58506,136635587,2022-02-08,10529728,Stan,"John's apartment was quite comfortable to stay in, with a beautiful view. It's not that close to shops, but is just a short uber from the Taronga ferry. "
58506,138054535,2022-02-08,69736679,Kryštof,"Apartment was not ready on time even, that host asked on time of arrival. First day host told us, that wifi is down and he will buy new router..wifi was available after 6 day from 7 day stay. All apartment was not cleaned well ( tile, carpet, couch, toilet, etc.). Towels which was available from host was used too much..dirty spots. Decription of the apartment was different from reality. It was not private apartment, but almost shared flat with host."
58506,139137555,2022-02-08,11096327,Luke,"John is an excellent host and offers his vast wealth of knowledge on Sydney and the surrounding area. Is fair to say that Mosman is a very wealthy and upmarket part of the city, 100% safe and friendly. <br/><br/>The apartment is located under Johns house and offers a vast living area for the money. The kitchen is basic but you could cook a simple meal, the local restaurant choices are extensive and of excellent quality. The 243 bus leaves for Sydney CBD at the top of the road which is a couple of mins walk. Get yourself an OPAL card for easy, stress free public transport.  <br/><br/>If you have kids (like us) the apartment offers an excellent alternative to a hotel as it gives you the room to spread out. <br/><br/>I loved my stay in Sydney and Mosman has some fantastic beaches, so don't hesitate to book this place as for the money it's a bargain "
58506,202765094,2022-02-08,97749571,Leonard,Great space. Hosts very good at communications let us check in a bit earlier which was welcome after long flight. Location nice and peaceful a bit like rainforest feel with birds chirping etc. Easy to get anywhere  . would use again if in Sydney
58506,200849077,2022-02-08,134640746,Paran,My parents were especially pleased.<br/>Mosman is a good neighborhood for a walk every day.
58506,199421921,2022-02-08,146090957,Andrew,"John and Pamela were relaxed, friendly and accommodating. A great introduction for us to Airbnb."
58506,198577401,2022-02-08,963235,Lynne,"We were on holiday in Sydney for a week (2 adults, 2 children). We chose this accommodation based on past reviews and have to say the accommodation was ideal and in a fantastic location in a quite suburb. Transport into the city was a 20min bus ride from a stop just metres away. As we had a car we also used the Mosman ferry terminal which was a 10 min drive and the views into Circular Quay were amazing. <br/>We had all the facilities we needed and John and Pam were the perfect hosts,  with nothing too much trouble. If your looking for a great air bnb experience in Sydney look no further."
58506,194983239,2022-02-08,39701800,Ikhwan Aizuddin,Location is great for public transport. Very quiet neighbourhood for relay your mind. All facilities in the house in good condition.

Excellent view, near to bus stop that will bring you to the city, comfortable beds & basically a great place to chill for family a vacation. <br/><br/>John was very friendly and helpful; giving us advise, being really flexible with our check-out timing etc. Would totally recommend you to stay in his apartment! <br/>Thank you John for hosting us:)<br/><br/>Cheers:)"

58506,141968544,2022-02-08,70268052,Eric,John's place is absolutely incredible!<br/>He was very nice to welcome and say goodbye to us during check-in & check-out.<br/>Lots of toys are available for our kids in the apartment and the garden.<br/>The proximity to the city cannot get any better and the view is beautiful. I was given a brief overview of the nearby history of the area and recommendations which was very helpful for being a first-timer in Sydney. The room and apartment is clean and good location to many places with plenty of fun things to do within the city. <br/>We would definitely stay here again.
58506,139900510,2022-02-08,17173448,Tom,John is a very helpful host. The accomidation is clean comfortable and with enough room to spread out and enjoy the view.

58506,109479128,2022-02-08,5051134,Deborah,"John made us feel very welcome immediately. We liked it when he told us stories of the area and also his own family and work history. The space is so light and airy and was a great place to relax and rejuvenate before our family wedding event. The beds were very comfy, and John even found another mattress for us when we needed it. "
58506,359986722,2022-02-08,187264334,Agata,"John and Pam are open, friendly and most helpful hosts. You will get all the tips you need to visit most interesting spots in Sydney. You can count on a pleasant chat every day. The studio is clean and has all the appliances you need to spend there holiday with kids."
58506,366585604,2022-02-08,117161804,Ronnie,"Johns place in Mosman was perfect for I and two friends. It was easy to get there and it was in a quiet and beautiful area. It was close to stores and the beach of Balmoral was just a short walk away. It is quite cheap taking an Uber into the CBD of Sydney or take the ferry and see Sydney from the water. John was very helpful and always answered fast if one had any questions. If you are looking for a place that has space, not in the middle of everything and is affordable this is the place."
58506,764572262,2022-02-08,22964829,Rebekah,Lovely location and great accomodation. Thanks John!
58506,741376067,2022-02-08,80075849,Melissa,Floor to ceiling windows that warp around the majority of studio giving you a magical view into the nature that abounds. The place has a very bohemian feel which to me is very Los Angeles. It’s roomy and it’s very private. You get a lot space for the price.
58506,717284677,2022-02-08,164167833,Karren,John’s place was great excellent location lovely accommodation good communication
58506,715062268,2022-02-08,2626059,Damien & Phoebe,"Perfect place for our weekend in Sydney with our two young boys. Really big spacious Studio, and with separate bedroom with the boys' bunks which was great for the evenings! Gorgeous location. Really well fitted out with everything you'd need, some great local tips and thoughtful little touches - bottle of milk, tea & coffee etc etc. John was also very generous with early check-in/ late check-out as they had no one either side of us - much appreciated. Overall, great little find!"
58506,714195739,2022-02-08,5428167,Fede,"Fantastic views, the garden is great for little kids. The place is located right in the middle harbour, very close to beautiful trails and schools. The hosts are very kind and generous, they have created a beautiful home for travelers."
58506,661975921,2022-02-08,99639740,Bob & Liz,John's place is light and spacious with a lovely view. John and Pam are great hosts.
58506,643130440,2022-02-08,9475705,Guy,"Fantastic place... one of the best! Clean, comfortable, stocked with everything terrific hosts and a great vista."
58506,622936527,2022-02-08,341871681,Sean,"Despite being in a global lockdown situation, Yindi and our hosts provided exceptional hospitality. The space in Yindi Studio provides a bright, airy and funky living and working area. The floor to ceiling windows can be drawn back allowing the noise of wildlife to fill the space, as well as cool it down quickly. <br/>The garden and patio is well maintained and a great place to enjoy dining outdoors..<br/>If you like walking this place is a perfect base to explore Sydney Harbourview National Park as well as the retail opportunities available in Mosman and beyond."
58506,609410035,2022-02-08,207675348,Darren,Great location. Johns interaction and area knowledge extremely helpful. Suburb has a great vibe and hospitality facilities
58506,608500142,2022-02-08,275485771,Joan,Place looking tired and cluttered and needs a lot of attention
58506,598379926,2022-02-08,317597717,Kate,"Nice and quiet, a bit tired. Easy street parking in a lovely area."
58506,593130721,2022-02-08,79226178,Gerry,"It’s a reasonable space, but appeared tired and worn. Expected a greater level of cleanliness throughout. There is only 2 cooking rings in kitchen, no oven and a very small TV.<br/>The unit is in a quiet residential area, but it is very hilly if you are walking, and Mosman shops are 20 minute walk."
58506,589425143,2022-02-08,2120581,Anton,"This is a large, modern, bright, open space.  It has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  John is a flexible, welcoming host who provides great tips about local amenities and transportation.  You are relatively close to a remarkable and stylish restaurant and shopping area.  Taronga Zoo is a short bus ride away as are ferries to the city.  There is quick bus service to the city almost at your doorstop.  The only drawback is that the bus is only hourly and does not operate Sunday evenings.  Other buses are a bit of a hike away, over hilly streets.  If you are happy to be out of the center of the city - and there are reasons to be - this is an excellent choice.  The value for such a large, sophisticated space is excellent."
58506,584332931,2022-02-08,255591507,Carole,"Exactly what it says on the tin! Comfortable, pleasant, good location and friendly, helpful hosts."
58506,581081120,2022-02-08,129025610,Kate,Another great stay at Studio Yindi! Perfect for kids. We hope to be back.
58506,767617231,2022-02-08,275604326,Cherrie,"A beautiful little hidden gem that we were over joyed to find! <br/>The on street parking was a little difficult at times but well worth it for the beautiful view you wake up to each morning. Not only did it have all the comforts of home, John was more than happy to arrange early check in. The whole area is full of wonderful places to see and only 5 mins drive from The Four Frogs Creperie... Definitely worth visiting!"
58506,578797927,2022-02-08,313508212,Shane,"Bus is close, nice home environment better than a motel for a family group."
58506,768477074,2022-02-08,21001258,Kristian,"We really enjoyed our stay with John and Pam. The studio is well appointed, quite large, clean and comes with access to a well maintained garden.

John was very understanding of the situation and I was so appreciative of that. I look forward to rebooking my stay as soon as I can."

58506,770671789,2022-02-08,132585384,Michelle,"Very happy to recommend this place. There was a bit of noise concerns from the hosts living above which resulted in some undesirable 7am starts to the day, but only on 2 out of the 5 nights we stayed, and this was definitely made up for by the beautiful view and location, and very friendly hosts, who were understanding and apologetic."

58506,432752699,2022-02-08,25973120,Carol,"Unfortunately this was THE WORST Airbnb we have ever stayed in. <br/>Obviously you get what you pay for. But I didn’t expect the uncleanliness we experienced here. <br/>The pillows were old and had a disgusting odour. The bed linen was old and didn’t feel clean. There was a hole in the ceiling above the bed. <br/>The kitchen table was sticky. The dishwashing liquid was empty. The cutlery was dirty. <br/>There was a disgusting odour coming from the bathroom floor drain. <br/>Both bottles of soap in the shower were were empty. One had a small amount watered down. No shampoo or conditioner. <br/>The windows and entry glass doors were filthy. <br/>The floor was sticky near the entry. <br/>There was dust and cobwebs. <br/>It was NOISY. <br/>We could here the hosts above us talking, walking around, and moving furniture. All evening!<br/>The neighbours were only a couple of metres away so we could hear them clearly. And they were LOUD!<br/>At 7 am they started sanding the deck next door metres from our bed. <br/>We packed up and left. Even though we were booked in for a second night. <br/>IT WAS A NIGHTMARE."

58506,457812669,2022-02-08,246879675,Kyung Ok,의사소통이 잘 되었고 호스트분들은 아주 친절했어요. 도움이 필요할때마다 적극 도와주셨어요. 첫날 도착했을때 아이가 있어어 배고플까봐 늦은밤인데도 마트까지 데려다주셨어요. 동네는 치안이 아주 좋았고 깨끗했어요. 시티는 아니지만 시티에 가는 버스노선이 많았어요. 출퇴근시간에는 243번이 자주오지만 낮에는 한시간에 한대만 와요. 하지만 시간표보고 시간표에 맞춰 다니면 많이 불편하지 않아요. 최근 안좋은 후기보고 가기전에 걱정했지만 저는 불편하지않고 잘 지내고 왔어요. 옆집은 공사했지만 많이 시끄럽지 않았어요. 거의 신경쓰이지 않았어요. 호스트분들이 넘 친절하시고 잘 머물고왔습니다

John was very hospitable, even when we were very delayed with our flight 6 hours behind schedule.  He went out of his way to make sure we were as comfortable as possible.  He went above and beyond.  The property is nice and privately located at the back of the residence.  It was a nice relaxing respite from our busy trip."

58506,553342587,2022-02-08,11113072,Ulrike,"To stay at Johns and Pams house was a great experience. They are extremly helpful, very kind, open hearded, child-friendly, interesting conversation partners and they think about our needs especialy as a family in Sydney (the welcome-milk in the fridge for the kids for example was awsome :) <br/>Grocery stores are 15 minutes by walk, the busstation 2 minutes, one nice playground 4 minutes and the neighbourhood is very nice and quiet.  In short: fantastic accommodation!!!"

He lent me and my kids cards for public transport and gave us some advice on where to go to see the sights and walk in the parks. The space was compact, simple and very comfortable. The location was also fantastic, only a short trip to trains, ferries and the zoo."

The sounds of only birds chirping was lovely.<br/><br/>The open plan layout was perfect for what we needed to get ready for the wedding and also have a nice relaxing outlook.<br/><br/>I was the bride staying their Friday night with my parents and 10 month old son. John brought down son additional toys and was very thoughtful. Saturday night my parents, sister and her partner stayed and had an enjoyable stay also.<br/><br/>We are very grateful for the gorgeous little place so practical and so close to our wedding ceremony and reception at the spot so great for the family :-) <br/><br/>Thank you to John for being so helpful and flexible. It was a lovely find. Would be nice to come back soon to reminisce our special day. "
58506,7815529,2022-02-08,8836737,Emma,Studio Yindi offered simple accommodation with everything we needed at a great price. The location was brilliant and the host excellent (thanks John). There was plenty of space and having a garden was really good (especially with kids). Would certainly recommend.
58506,4815867,2022-02-08,6326015,Najieb,John's place was in a nice suburb close to public transport.john himself is a very nice person and he is very helpful regarding any concerns you may have his place is more suited for a family with kids but we had fun so I suppose anyone can .
58506,4604846,2022-02-08,524675,Sally,"We really enjoyed our stay at Studio Yindi.  John was a welcoming and helpful host (assisting us with navigating Sydney) by providing us with directions and maps.  The place is great value dollars wise (compared to booking a hotel room!).  The accommodation is very spacious, clean, the beds comfortable and warm.  
<br/>
<br/>It is also located in the lovely North Shore of Sydney - Taronga Zoo is a 5 minute drive and city 10-15mins...  We will definately stay here again on our next Sydney adventure...
<br/>"
58506,4116088,2022-02-08,5050767,Anne-Jo,"We had a great time in the spacious apartment in the beautiful neighbourhood Mosman. At the end of the street, you can take the bus. Within 15 minutes you're downtown. With a family with two young children, this was a good deal. Yohn is nice and helpful host. "
58506,3979302,2022-02-08,2777628,Valerie,"Well we were rather surprised to find that the area was so  hilly when we arrived, thank goodness we decided to get a cab from the city. My husband has Emphysema and had I known the area I would not have booked it. We actually found it to be quite noisy from the owners above they didn't seem to be concerned that there were guests in the flat under them and it sounded morning and night like a herd of elephants above us, also I don't know that the door that divide to owners house from the flat I didn't think afforded that much privacy, they appeared to be very flimsy and we were always hearing scratching noises, which was a bit disconcerting. I think it is a fairly cheap sort of set up and not what I would consider any more than 3 stars at the most. We would not stay there again.
<br/>"
58506,3928092,2022-02-08,5101932,Joyce,"We stayed two nights at Studio Yindi which is airy and spacious, located in a safe and leafy suburb. It is 5 mins drive to the beautiful Balmoral Beach. We know Sydney quite well already and so John let us enjoy absolute privacy during our stay. We had no problems finding parking. Thanks John for a wonderful stay! "
58506,3857192,2022-02-08,3564981,Alena,My mother and I enjoyed staying at John's spacious Studio Yindi which has a very pleasant garden. The location is probably the best for those with a car. But if you don't mind a ten minute walk up the road to the shops and main road or have patience to wait for public transport or taxi then the place would be ideal as it really gives a sense of home. We did not have a chance to talk to John much as we were busy running around but it is obvious that he hosted many happy travellers from around the world and can provide a good advice on things to do to explore Sydney.

On the first day, John showed us around the area for shopping facilities. He was also very helpful with any ""travel needs"" we had, e.g. printing airline tickets etc. 
<br/>
<br/>The area is very quiet and safe. There are walking trails nearby. There is a nice Yoga Studio close by. Balmoral Beach (with the best Fish&Chips :-) ) Is up the hill and down again, about 20 minutes walking.
<br/>
<br/>We definitely recommend the studio for your visit to Sydney and would go back anytime."

58506,3219657,2022-02-08,4045664,Anders,"Stayed for a month with 3 kids and it was great. Good studio, nice garden, great people. The location is a bit off the beaten track; on the other hand the neighborhood is very plesant and quiet."
58506,2884986,2022-02-08,1690451,Niek,Mosman is a very nice place to stay when exploring the Sydney region. The studio is located in a quit residential area and with John's help we were able to use the public transport (both ferry & bus) to take us to the city center. There is also a nice beach nearby.
58506,2586045,2022-02-08,2490391,Helen,"Studio Yindi was excellent value for us we booked it for a month . It was well equiped , light and spacious . Ideal location to catch the bus 2 mins from apartment to go into the city . We had a car , but we did also use public transport . Everything you need is in the apartment , nice garden to sit in the evening , and watch the numerous birds , fruit bats , roost in the trees .  John and Pam were very nice and helpful hosts .Nothing was too much trouble for them , they are very knowedgable about places to visit ."

58506,7925967,2022-02-08,912923,Matt,"Great place for a few people to stay.  It did help to have a Rental Car to get around as buses and walking would take some time.  The area is in a great neighborhood with lots to see and do within 5-20 min car ride.  
<br/>
<br/>The studio apt was suitable for 3-4 people.  We did awaken to chirping birds early each morning (5AM), but otherwise slept fine.   "
58506,1982345,2022-02-08,2727209,Jeongtae,Jong's Studio was great place to stay in. The facilities are beyoud my expectations and also the pictures shown at the profile. I and my family spent there really happy time together. It was very quiet and spacious and also warm. And the environment was so beautiful. We walked go out and come back by walking. Thank you John and Pam. I strongly recommend this place to others who find good accomodations. 
58506,8129446,2022-02-08,6228815,Talia,"I was visting Australia when my sister/ best friend was getting married there in October 2013.  My eight year old son, my mother and I stayed in Austrailia for 3 weeks, and we spent 3 nights at Studio Yindi in Mosman.  We thought that Studio Yindi was a comforatble, safe, quaint but bareboned apartment.  Good location.. safe and beautiful scenery, walking distance to Spit's Junction, great stores and resturants.  Buses are close by and the ferry is easy to get to off the bus.  The apartment is funky, old fashoined and sparse, but you get what you pay for.  "
58506,8727327,2022-02-08,305587,Mireille,"John and Pam hosted the lot of us (myself, husband, son, parents and sister, whew!) in the ground floor unit below their residence for 3 weeks. We all converged on Sydney for a wedding and family reunion of sorts, and our party's volume waxed and waned like the moon throughout our stay. But throughout it they were fantastic hosts and we even got the chance to spend some time sharing stories and drinks with them.
<br/>
<br/>It was the perfect place for my parents and 2.5 year old son, who spent the most time there and got to enjoy a peaceful side to a major metropolis. 
<br/>
<br/>All in all, everyone had a wonderful time and we owe them a great deal of thanks for accommodating us!"
58506,11826324,2022-02-08,11242158,Vanessa,"Great studio in a pleasant location. Very central to the city- taxi to CBD in about 10mins. very roomy with good amenities. John was considerate, on one morning we woke to footsteps and plumbing usage above our bedroom at 6am and mentioned this & they were very quiet the next morning which was great.  I think its good value for money compared to a lot of Sydney accommodation on offer. "
58506,11655977,2022-02-08,9656517,Purnata,"We had a memorable time at John's place. We mostly used to be out, but felt completely at home at all times we were there. John and Pam are friendly and helpful, and we will consider staying again on our next visit !"

<br/>It isn't great for really young kids, probably not for under 5 years. I also found it a bit too dirty, but to be fair I didn't raise this with John while there.
<br/>"
58506,11282224,2022-02-08,1396644,Raquel,"John is the perfect host. He was at home when we arrived there and he help us with all that we need to know and gave us some advices were to go or what to see that we love it.
<br/>
<br/>The house is perfect and very near to the centre, you have buses and everything you can need it at any moment.

58506,11167992,2022-02-08,4643721,Kerry,"We really enjoyed our stay at Studio Yindi - it was just right for us.  We had complete privacy, but were still able to interact with Pam and John whenever we wanted to.  The neighbourhood was charming - loved being woken up to the sounds of the birds, but at the same time it was peaceful and quiet.  Close to public transportation routes if you are ok with hilly walks...we are.  Lots of room to spread out and feel comfortable."

Away from big city life (yet close enough and easy to reach with the bus), the charming studio with a pretty little garden was very relaxing. John and his  wife were very friendly and helpful! Would stay here again anytime!"
58506,9698497,2022-02-08,5184749,Stefan,"Fantastic place, very nice and helpful hosts. A bit out of hectic Sydney CBD, in a posh suburb, with loads of birds, and about 2 km to Balmoral beach. Fully equipped, nice for a smaller family. A good base if you have time, and are in no rush to see all ""Sydney sights""."
58506,9280659,2022-02-08,5584285,Kerrie,"We had a wonderful stay at Studio Yindi. John was extremely helpful, despite his wife being unwell at the time. We would not hesitate to recommend Studio Yindi, particularly loved the private garden and deck chairs which made our stay very relaxing."

58506,8199853,2022-02-08,9319623,Daniel,"Great accommodation, lovely area and friendly hosts. Would highly recommend this well priced accommodation and hope to stay here again."
58506,1895378,2022-02-08,1840907,Diana,Studio Yindi is very spacious and light with all basic requirements available. Host John Young respected our privacy but also was available to chat and advise on best local eateries.  Weather was very cold but Studio Yindi is comfortable with efficient gas heaters. A lovely part of Mosman to be in. We would like to stay again. 
58506,1848695,2022-02-08,2459151,Cynthia,"After a 15-hour flight from L.A., we needed a brief respite in a quiet and convenient location in Sydney. And that's exactly what we found at Studio Yindi. Long before our arrival, host John Young provided clear / concise directions and options to reach Studio Yindi from the airport. Upon our arrival and during our stay, he suggested ferry rides and landmarks / sites to visit ""off the beaten path"" such as Cockatoo Island that we found very enjoyable. Studio Yindi itself is clean and well provisioned: two space heaters to keep the chill off in winter and ample flatware and utensils for those wishing to prepare breakfasts or other meals to hold down expenses. Public buses to / from the City run very frequently, making Studio Yindi an easy commute to all the tourist spots. "
58506,1767320,2022-02-08,2131674,Hock Huat,"Studio Yindi is very well set up and it definitely feels like home.  My family had so much fun here.
<br/>
<br/>The host, John and his wife are also very helpful and prompt with all my queries prior to our arrival and had also showed consideration and flexibility in allowing us an early check in and late check out on our booking dates.
<br/>
<br/>I would definitely recommend Studio Yindi to those  who intend to visit Sydney."
58506,360222,2022-02-08,598354,Nancy,"John was extremely generous host--offered us lots of local information, occasional rides and use of a computer.  His wife gave me an excellent book suggestion.  Both are friendly and welcoming.  The location is a 15 minute bus ride (over the Harbor Bridge) to downtown Sydney or a slightly longer trip on the ferry (passing glorious views of the Opera House and Harbor Bridge)  It is not a luxurious accommodation but having a kitchen and washing machine make it very attractive to budget conscious travelers."
58506,315082,2022-02-08,632125,Helen,"We had a fantastic family weekend in Sydney, and Studio Yindi served as the ideal base-camp. We had everything we needed at our disposal, and our hosts were kind to check in with us every now and then to ensure that was the case. "
58506,299687,2022-02-08,373745,Duncan,"My sisters, Mum and I had a lovely weekend at Studio Yindi. John met us as we arrived and gave us helpful local information about transport, getting supplies and good places to eat. There was helpful transport information in the unit. We were warm and cosy, a quiet space for us to spend time together and talk a lot."
58506,247550,2022-02-08,316457,Viv,"John and Pam made us very welcome.  John was kind enough to show us round the area in his car and gave us lifts to the ferry and restaurant area of Mosman. The accommodation is spacious but basic.  The floor is mostly bare concrete, although there are a couple of rugs and the bedroom is carpeted. There is no oven, just a double hob.  Also drying clothes in wet weather is a problem.  The studio is in a pleasant street, very peaceful with a small garden.  There is a regular bus service into the city.  "
58506,243533,2022-02-08,477302,Joyce,John and Pam are good host who provide help whenever required.   We enjoy the 6-day stay at their studio.   The studio is tranquil and spacious with beautiful natural scene and nice neighbors.  Transport is convenient to the city and the beaches nearby.   Remember to visit Manly and Balmoral Beach.  They are fabulous!
58506,233957,2022-02-08,407400,Michelle,"We loved staying at Studio Yindi. Perfect position to see the Sydney sights, yet quiet and private. John and Pam were fantastic hosts...friendly and full of local knowledge and guidance. We would have liked to spend a bit more time getting to know them better, but everyone's schedules were very hectic! Next time John, I'll bring my paint clothes and give you a hand! The Studio itself is charming with everything we needed at hand. Waking up hearing the birds in the morning was wonderful...such a quiet street that it felt we could have been miles away from busy Sydney. Buses and ferries only a short walk away... perfect position. Thanks so much for helping make our stay so lovely...we'll be back for sure! xxx"
58506,227747,2022-02-08,358277,Susan,"We had a wonderful stay at Studio Yindi, which was lovely and fully equipped for our needs. The wireless internet was definitely a plus, and busing/ferrying into the city was convenient. "
58506,221734,2022-02-08,345733,David,"John and Pam were excellent hosts, very helpful and informative about the local area. they arranged taxis etc without any problems at all. The apartment itself was certainly big enough for our family of 3 and we could have comfortably fitted another person in  it. whilst it was described as a fully working kitchen it was only a portable 2 ring cooker and full laundry facilities - be aware the washing machine is shared with the main house and they require access to what is effectively your space to use it.
<br/>it would also benefit from a thorough cleaning from top to bottom and we felt we left it cleaner than when we arrived although on the day we  left the next people were due to arrive an hour after our vacating the property so we were asked to wash the bedding in time for the next person. this quick turnaround is not enough time to cater for people correctly. "
58506,197657,2022-02-08,353996,Daniel,"We enjoyed staying with John and Pam, who were very kind and gracious hosts."
58506,187372,2022-02-08,356662,Sandy,"We stayed at studio yindi for a week in february and had a great stay. We travelled around sydney purely using buses and would recommend a look at the sydney buses website as the bus stop is a 5 minute walk. Mosman is a great area to stay in, and any travel to the CBD involves a wee trip over the harbour bridge which we never got bored of, and it is also quite handy for Manly and Balmoral beach which are both wonderful. John and Pam are excellent hosts and very knowledgable about Sydney in fact John even took us out in his boat which was one of the highlights of our trip. "
58506,183423,2022-02-08,340181,Rodney,"My partner, Mom and I stayed at Studio Yindi last week.  The apartment had everything we needed - coffee maker, hairdryer, washing machine, and lots more.  We loved the downtown Mosman area which is about a 15 minute walk from the studio (or a super short bus ride) and really enjoyed exploring surrounding Cremorne and Balmoral on foot.    Getting in and out of CBD by bus is super easy as well.  John is a great host, I would definitely recommend this accommodation to others.  "
58506,180643,2022-02-08,376621,Shahar,"Studio Yindi is by far the best value accommodation option in North Sydney. The price per square meter beats any other offer for sure... it has privacy and a small garden, parking is free (which is not so common in Sydney) and John is a great and helpful host. "
58506,172405,2022-02-08,237665,Kate,"When staying at Studio Yindi i was a backpacker and hence the facilities seemed extremely luxurious. If you are looking for a nice place to crash then this is perfect. The hosts gave us a friendly welcome and the place itself is fairly well equipped. Lovely spacious area to chill out in with a small bedroom on the side. The kitchen facilities are not as brilliant as they could be - lacking an oven or hob, however if you are wanting to eat out a lot or can prepare microwave meals then this isn't an issue. It's a nice location with suitable walks around the area and a bus service nearby. I enjoyed staying here and would return."
58506,163428,2022-02-08,281945,Barbora,"The house has a great location.....close to the public transport, the bech, restaurants, shops and close enough to the city....
<br/>there is a lot of place in the apartment, and a nice garden right in front....
<br/>all the basic kitchenware is there, as well as a washing machine....
<br/>and John and Pam are very nice and extremly helpful hosts...."
58506,107988523,2022-02-08,38440173,Anna,The studio was perfect for what we needed in our short stay. The area was lovely and very quiet. Super for walks down to the bay. The house provided us with everything we needed from wi fi to a hairdryer to a washing machine and detergent. The host allowed us to arrive early which was a great bonus due to us arriving in Sydney at 5am.
58506,409137,2022-02-08,799036,Jeffrey,John is the perfect host.  Very welcoming and accommodating.   I loved the studio and will be sad to leave.
58506,446195,2022-02-08,777663,Srini,We stayed at Yindi for four nights.  It was a nice place and the best part was John's personal willingness to help with local transportation as well as provide good local insights. The accommodation is in a nice residential neighborhood and.  We enjoyed our stay.
58506,502296,2022-02-08,863531,Lisa,"The place was comfortable, spacious, and well equipped. The location was quite convenient and peaceful. The host, John, was very friendly and helpful.  He guided us with better options for directions.  We all were happy and satisfied."
58506,515290,2022-02-08,254365,Maureen,"Hospitality is alive and well in living at Studio Yindi! What a fabulous experience--both in the accommodations and the assistance provided by John. As Americans visiting Australia for the first time, we didn't know anything about how to get around and John took care of things before we even had to ask.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment itself was perfect for our needs, with easy-to-access (and fast) Internet, comfy beds and a wonderfully hot shower.
<br/>
<br/>A perfect Aussie experience!

58506,1553626,2022-02-08,1440931,Veri,"John and Pam were great hosts. Even before I got to Australia, John gave me heaps of information not only about Sydney but all the other places I was planning to visit. He was very responsive and got back to me very quickly and was vey helpful In every instance. The day we arrived, Pam was nice enough to give us a ride to the grocery since it was raining. They often offered to give us a ride whenever they could.
<br/>Their home is in a beautiful location; in fact, we couldn't have asked for a better one. The Studio had everything you will ever need and at one point we needed an extra bed for my mom and John was able get us another bed. My husband had an incident whilst Pam and John were out of town they were very helpful and even from a distance were able to help my husband sort things out.
<br/>We will always cherish the time we spent at Studio Yindi. We would definitely recommend Studio Yindi to anyone and would stay here again. Thank you John and Pam for the lovely time!"

<br/>
<br/>The accommodation was everything I expected, with a few added conveniences, including wifi. Beds and furniture were comfortable, the kitchen had all useful stuff one might want, and building itself was light and airy. 
<br/>
<br/>John was a gracious and informative host (you're welcome to pick his brain about public transport), and I would be pleased to stay there again. "

58506,1245207,2022-02-08,1528802,Henry,It was not easy for our children to leave everything and everyone they've ever known behind in Florida and come to Australia. John Young went a long way in easing our transition. It also helped that John's dog Muffin took to the kids and let them befriend her. I would recommend staying with John!
58506,1090180,2022-02-08,1920308,Marc,"Excellent place to stay, lovely neighbourhood, very convenient as the studio is very well equipped. John has been a wonderful host, helping us whenever we needed to. Would love to come back if Australia wasn't so far from France!"
58506,1057944,2022-02-08,1710744,Kate,"A lovely part of Sydney to stay in - a leafy affluent suburb, with great views of the harbour from the end of the street.  Within 20 minutes walk of a busy shopping strip, with frequent bus routes passing.  This is a great spot as it is close to the CBD, Kirribilli and also Manly.  
<br/>
<br/>John was helpful and the house well equipped with the cooking facilities (lots of pots and pans, utensils etc) being excellent.

58506,1032248,2022-02-08,1848568,Massimiliano,"A perfect, comfortable, lovely accomodation for our week in Sydney! 
<br/>John was a great host, really family-friendly and despite being so busy he let us know that he was available should we have needed anything.
<br/>The apartment is very spacious, well equipped, with a nice garden and Mosman is a quiet, charming suburb close to the city centre. The ideal location, even for a family with children.
<br/>Highly recommended!

58506,12110570,2022-02-08,1699906,Rowena,"My husband, teenage daughter and myself had a week staying at Studio Yindi.
<br/>The Studio was spacious, clean, an outside private area to sit listening to the birds was a highlight. We found John very helpful and the communication beforehand was fantastic, lots of ideas of places to visit in Sydney etc. The price was very reasonable too. We will be back for sure and recommend this accommodation to anyone normally we would stay in a 4 or 5 star hotel but thought we would give this a go. I am glad we did as it gave me more money to spend on shopping!  The kitchen was well equipped to so we had a few meals in as well."
58506,999028,2022-02-08,1616833,Paul,"John and Pam are an extremely nice, helpful and generous couple. The accomodation was exactly what we wanted and expected...clean, well equipped, comfortable, quiet and not pretentious! Mosman and the surrounding area is fantastic with lots to see and do. There are plenty of excellent cafes and restaurants nearby. The bus is close and if you are visiting on a Sunday, take advantage of the inexpensive allday fare available for families ($10 for family of 4) on all Sydney bus, ferries and trains. Studio Yindi is an excellent spacious base for exploring Sydney. Book it and you won't be dissapointed! Thanks John and Pam and we will definitely see you again soon!"
58506,884870,2022-02-08,1529156,John,"The Yindi Studio was great. comfortable, clean with everything needed for a business stay. John the host was laid back and friendly. Fully recommend to anyone thinking of  a change from hotel life! jd"
58506,880147,2022-02-08,867445,François,"We spent a real nice time in the Studio. Yindi studio is located in a quiet suburb very near from Sydney Center and the beach. John was very helpful : dropping us at the harbour, at the train station, showing us the area around the studio, giving to us a lot of information .... 
<br/>We enjoyed our stay in Mosman. It was really easy to visit Sydney and the Blue Mountains.
<br/>We  hope that we can come again  !"
58506,828607,2022-02-08,927891,Emma,Great location. Well appointed and airy unit which suited us as a family of four perfectly for our six day stay. Friendly and very helpful hosts. 
58506,597079,2022-02-08,687282,Fergus,"Loved our stay in Studio Yindi. Really quite location, close to bus routes into CBD. 15 mins walk to the center of Mosman and only a short trip to Balmoral beach. Would love to return again."

<br/>everything is great!"
58506,12602115,2022-02-08,7761305,Julien,"Le quartier de Mosman où se situe la location de John est magnifique, calme, à deux pas de l'arrêt de bus pour Sydney (accès au centre ville en 30 minutes) et assez proche à pied du centre de Mosman, de la plage et des commerces (30 minutes à pied).
<br/>La location est bien équipée (Wifi, machine à laver le linge), lumineuse et assez grande pour une famille de 4 personnes.
<br/>John est très sympathique et serviable.
<br/>Il faut noter toutefois que le studio est assez froid (sur la période du mois de mai) malgré la présence de chauffages d'appoint au gaz. Nous avons été assez déçus de la propreté des lieux (WC, vaisselle et poussière sur les canapés et sol). Enfin, le studio n'est séparé de la maison de John que par une porte coulissante laissant passer tous les bruits de la vie courante....
<br/>Malgré ces désagréments, le studio de John reste une bonne étape dans la banlieue de Sydney.
<br/>"
58506,2227914,2022-02-08,2438815,Breige,Appartment Yindi was great had everything needed for a long stay.  John was very helpful as was his wife would highly recommend a stay here.  My husband loved the private garden in fact with the wonderful Sydney weather it was hard to get him to leave it.  Would love to come back and stay here again.

<br/>Minpuntje: Helaas vonden we de bedden niet super fris."
58506,51105677,2022-02-08,27439547,Tara,"John was lovely and greeted me as soon as I arrived at the property. I was allowed to check in early, but was held up running pre-wedding errands. The studio was located close to Balmoral Beach where I got married on the weekend. Thank you for having me and my bridesmaids."

58506,42245190,2022-02-08,26445478,Monte,"John and Pam were wonderful hosts.  We could not have asked for better.  They had multiple great suggestions for travel and sight-seeing.  The studio was perfect for our family of four.  There was plenty of room and we were very close to public transportation.  The studio is located in Mosman, a suburb of Sydney, and is located very close to all of the famous sites.  It is a very safe place and we felt very comfortable walking home at night.  I would highly recommend Studio Yindi for anybody traveling to the Sydney area."
58506,33708961,2022-02-08,2769114,Melissa,"I stayed at studio Yindi with my family and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We didn't spend too much time there as we were out a lot but the time we did stay was pleasant! It's in a great spot away from the city but still close enough to get into with ease, the place was clean and would highly recommend. I personally didn't meet John as I arrived later but my parents said that he was great to deal with and very friendly. I would definitely stay again! Thanks "

The hosts were lovely, warm, welcoming and very very helpful - a real pleasure to meet them. The studio was nice, clean, comfortable and pretty much as we expected from the description and the pictures. The garden and view was beautiful, with all sorts of subtropical plants and birds and very quiet, tranquil and relaxing. A perfect base for us to explore Sydney! :-)"

<br/>L'appartement est bien situé dans le très beau quartier de Mosman qui est à 20 minutes du CBD en bus.
<br/>En revanche l'appartement est assez humide et ce n'était pas vraiment propre.
<br/>"
58506,60750231,2022-02-08,22777289,Darren,"John greeted us with a friendly chat about the local services and amenities. He is a gracious host and gentleman. The studio was as described and we would certainly be happy to stay there again.

58506,104859717,2022-02-08,91369912,Joanne,Great private home away from home. It was nice and quiet in a family friendly neighbourhood which was exactly what we needed after a hard day. Thanks for everything.
58506,103670159,2022-02-08,23645715,Tasma,A fantastic little pad! Cheap and cheerful with everything you need! Super central spot for zipping around and street parking. 
58506,103332665,2022-02-08,56381253,Monja,John was a very good host. Very helpful. Lovely outlook from the flat and great location. 
58506,101233175,2022-02-08,19596141,Zosia,"John and Pamela were very warm accommodating hosts. Their studio was clean and comfortable and everything we needed for our short stay in Mosman. The neighbour hood is beautiful and only a short walk from some great cafes.
<br/>
<br/>John was kind enough to check in on us and make sure we felt at home and knew where everything was. The communication from the moment we booked was excellent. I would recommend Studio Yindi to anyone! Thank you John and Pamela!"
58506,99977601,2022-02-08,66285787,Carina,"We enjoyed our stay in Mosman. John was welcoming and responsive from the second I contacted him and all the way through our stay and after wards as well. He made us feel very welcome and greeted us at the door, followed us down the stairs with a big flashlight as one of the outside lights were broken. This was fixed the next day. He went through the apartment and amenities as well as bus plans etc. This place is great value for money. "
58506,97561185,2022-02-08,15546470,Katrina,"John was extremely helpful and full of good tourist recommendations and local stories. The neighborhood was beautiful and quiet; a pleasant place to walk.
<br/>
<br/>Studio Yindi surpassed all our expectations and we couldn't be happier with our stay. "
58506,30998352,2022-02-08,28789413,Nicolette,"Technically the host did everything we would expect, the key was in the key safe, the wifi password was on piece of paper and the apartment had all the rooms and furniture one would expect. But the experience was not great, the apartment was superficially 'cleaned', all of the furniture were rejects from the owners house to fill space, nothing matched, pieces of carpet were thrown together. There was no wardrobe in the bedroom or open space to unpack my kids clothing. There was a hanging rail for the adult stuff which is in open view to all. There is a very strange outlet water pipe that stuck out at the top of the bedroom which everytime water trickled through startled me, as if it was going to pour on my head. But most of all the noise is the biggest issue, there is no sound isolation between the apartment and the owner upstairs, our sleeping times were determined by theirs. It wasn't just foot steps, you could hear what TV programme they were watching, dinner conversations - everything. With two small inquisitive children, this was not ideal at all.   "
58506,75616130,2022-02-08,50690036,Stevie,"John and Pam both greeted us at the door, showing us the way to the accommodation. Both excellent and excited to have my family there. Thank you again. Xxx"
58506,74121423,2022-02-08,66792436,Bonnie,"Very welcoming. Really good space for our family of 2 adults and 2 little kids. Wifi is reliable. For small kids be aware that there is no bath and they can't be in the garden unsupervised as there are some drops and it is not gated. Good parking and access to bus into city. Tea, coffee, sugar and washing powder was a nice touch!"
58506,72061070,2022-02-08,36919700,Xiaoxuan,It was a great time to stay here and it is near the Opera and downtown which enabled us to visit around. The place we stayed actually is the backyard of the whole house and it was good enough to stay with 4 adults. The kitchen equipment is all we want.
58506,71753897,2022-02-08,43453354,Clery,"Studio Yindi was a great place to stay. Hosts made us welcome, good space, good location and good aspect. Description on site was accurate and photos realistic. It was easy to park on the street outside and very close to bus stop for bus to city."
58506,71243347,2022-02-08,25554295,Endel,"Studio Yindi was as described and allowed us easy access to the city and surrounds. The bush outlook from the lounge was private and allowed a good view of the sunset. John was not intrusive and dropped by to check if we needed anything and made us feel at home.
<br/>On street parking was always available.  
<br/>The path at the side of the house can be a bit dark at night and it wasn't completely spotless, but OK.
<br/>"
58506,70707369,2022-02-08,40810359,Julius,"Es hat uns sehr gut gefallen! Das Apartment liegt in einer sehr schönen Umgebung, allerdings kann man wegen der Steigungen weniger zu Fuß erreichen als eigentlich gedacht. Mit dem Bus ist aber alles sehr gut erreichbar. Der Spielplatz um die Ecke hat unsere Kinder sehr erfreut. Das Apartment ist funktional eingerichtet, auch die Küchenausstattung ist ok, allerdings gibt es nur zwei Kochplatten. Die Ecke mit den Einzelbetten ist vom offenen Bereich so weit abgetrennt, dass unsere Kinder dort schlafen konnten, auch wenn wir noch mit Licht im Wohnzimmer saßen. John war sehr freundlich. Er hatte vor unserer (späten) Ankunft noch ein paar Dinge für uns eingekauft, hat uns bei der Orientierung geholfen und uns am Ende auch noch auf ein Glas Wein eingeladen. Insgesamt unbedingt empfehlenswert!"
58506,62330827,2022-02-08,4314951,Mark,"Studio Yindi was everything John said it was, great location perfect for our week stay."

<br/>The Studio was exactly as described and very family friendly. The kids loved it!
<br/>Easy access to the ferry and then the city. Close to Mosman shops and local attractions.
<br/>We had a great stay and won't be surprised if we visit again!"

<br/>"
58506,58484954,2022-02-08,2164920,Monique,"We had a great stay at Studio Yindi. John was welcoming and friendly without being intrusive. The accommodation had all the facilities you would need for a short stay, including an iron, hairdryer, plenty of kitchen equipment and extra sheets and towels if needed. The view from the glass doors in living room gave the place a great open feel and a nice green leafy outlook.
<br/>I know the Northern Beaches well but I have never stayed in Mosman and we found it to be a good location with loads of restaurants, cafes and supermarkets nearby. Balmoral beach is a very short drive away also. "
58506,19407069,2022-02-08,9068916,Victor,"A great cozy place to stay, away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. A comfortable getaway for families. There's a cute little dog that will come over every morning looking for food too! 
<br/>My family loved the place and we will be back here if we visit sydney again in the future, thanks a lot John. :)
<br/>"
58506,22120454,2022-02-08,16981648,Zeynep & Nicolas,"John was very kind and helpful during our stay. The house was really convenient and nice with a small garden for our kids to play in.  I would recommend this house to everyone. Definitely worth for the value. Moving around needed some effort, hilly areas are good sport for adults, but sometimes too much for kids. It took 15 minutes walk to the market or 30 minutes to Balmoral Beach, which was wonderful. There is a bus stop close to the house.. And good connection to the city. Mosman is one of the nicest suburbs of Sydney. Expensive houses, beautiful cars and people, everything clean, proper and pretty. "
58506,19943196,2022-02-08,9116638,Dragos,We stayed with John for 2 days only and felt very comfortable.<br/>John is an excellent host very accommodating & helpful.<br/>The accommodation had plenty of space was clean and had all the requirments to be self suficient.<br/>We had great fun and would hapily recommend John to other travelers.
58506,19842214,2022-02-08,242003,Merran,Very comfy apartment in a lovely part of Sydney. Well-equipped kitchen and nice to have a separate dining and lounge area. John's communication was great and he was within easy reach if we needed anything. I particularly liked the lush green view through the full length windows - made for a very tranquil start to the morning. I was also lucky enough to see the blue-tongue lizard sunning itself in the garden one day! Thanks for a great stay.
58506,19588097,2022-02-08,11902573,Dan,"John and Pam are excellent hosts.  We had some good quality communication prior to our stay, and it paid off.  John was ready with really good recommendations for us in the Mosman area.  The unit has everything we needed.  I'm not sure why Oz AirBnB reviews cite plenty of hot water, but there was plenty of hot water!
<br/>We arrived in a rental car, and found plentiful parking on the street right in front.  It was a five minute drive to the Mosman ferry dock, and parking there all day is free.  With multimode transit passes, that was our most pleasant and scenic gateway to the Sydney area, featuring the iconic view of the opera house and harbor (yeah, we're Americans) bridge.  John had pointed out the Mosman rowing club with its welcome pint at the end of the day.  On top of all that, John and Pam invited us up for a Sunday afternoon glass of wine and showed us his blowaway collection of aboriginal art.
<br/>
<br/>We recommend this property."
58506,19054306,2022-02-08,14061885,Scott,"My family stayed four nights at Studio Yindi. John was very welcoming and extremely helpful when we arrived.

We will definitely stay there again when we visit Sydney."
58506,18797679,2022-02-08,704377,Michelle,We enjoyed our stay at John's apartment. It would have been more convenient if we had a car but public transport is adequate with proper planning (particularly on weekends). John was kind enough to take us to the city on Sunday morning to meet our train as the buses start quite late on Sunday. 
58506,18519584,2022-02-08,9695085,Aish,"John was there and welcomed us upon arrival and regularly checked to see if we were ok. Modest accommodation that consists of old appliances, concrete flooring and old fashioned gas heaters that release a strong smell which made us feel uncomfortable and light headed at times.  "
58506,17839940,2022-02-08,12282785,Yerim,"John was the first impression is very friendly. he was  easy to communicate for me do not speak English. The house has everything you need in a good hair dryer, ironing board, towels and so on. The bus stop is in front of the house was in a convenient zone.  But, because we are familiar with under-floor heating for the winter culture of Korea was a little chilly house. Two days I was able to travel to Sydney to stay comfortable while we are at home in the zone. thank u so much john! :-)"
58506,17340622,2022-02-08,11789874,Pearl,"John is a fantastic host, easy to communicate with, very friendly and helpful with any questions regarding the area.  The apartment is quite spacious and comfortable for my family (myself, my husband and two teenage daughters),  very accessible by public transport, and near shops and restaurants.  Checking in was quite flexible as we arrive at night, and John was very helpful in getting us settled.  He has a lot of brochures regarding Sydney  and tips on how to get around and what to do.    He is very friendly and warm person and is always willing to suggest fun things to do around the area like the Spit bridge to Manly walk to enjoy the coast, cliffs, and harbour views.  We have walked to Balmoral beach from his place, and it is very beautiful.  We have been to Sydney 15 years ago, though not in his vicinity, and this is the first time my daughters have seen the area,  so it was a great vacation for us.   We had a comfortable and enjoyable stay at John's place and we're very thankful that he has accepted us as his guests.  "

58506,15159080,2022-02-08,2985233,Christopher,John is a fantastic host. His home is exactly as described and our little family had a wonderful stay. Open living areas spill onto a sun drenched lawn - perfect for our 14m.o. to acquire an early taste for Mosman living! Would definitely recommend.
58506,14951832,2022-02-08,12714979,Cheryl,"It was easy to communicate with John before our stay. He was very helpful and prompt with his replies. John met us on arrival and was very pleasant. He also popped in during our stay to check that all was well. The studio was as we expected from the listing. It was comfortable, with good heating and in a peaceful location. We travelled by car, but there was a bus stop within a stone's throw of the studio with a regular service to the city. This was our first experience of airbnb accommodation and we were impressed. "
58506,30497676,2022-02-08,27834692,Mirla,Studio Yindi was a fantastic place to stay. Very close to public transport and the shops. We travelled with 3 children and we were all very comfortable esoecially given we had to stay indoors for 2 days due to a once in ten year storm. Thank heavens for the free wifi! Both John and his wife were very helpful and kind.
58506,14072935,2022-02-08,11108575,Jessi,"Highly recommend! My family and I really enjoyed staying in Studio Yindi! The studio was big enough for us and just right for us! Simply it had got everything we needed, hot shower, cosy sofa, big beds, evern kitchen utilities! The owner, Mr. John Young was very helpful in every way! We would definitely stay in Stuido Yindi if we have another chance to visit Sydney! "
58506,22521965,2022-02-08,6690154,Craig,"The description of the property was accurate and correct. It was on a very quiet street, a stones throw from the major suburbs of Mosman and Neutral Bay. John had left the light on for our arrival and was in touch often before we arrived, to make sure everything was OK (and it was).
<br/>
<br/>The studio could easily sleep for and although it was only the two of us, it would be fine for a small family or close group.
<br/>
<br/>We left Canberra at 3:15 on Friday, arrived at Studio Yindi, dropped the bags off and were in Circular Quay by 7:30pm.
<br/>
<br/>The Mosman ferry terminal was a 5 minute drive and perfect for getting across to the City.
<br/>
<br/>All in all very good."
58506,23888034,2022-02-08,11831939,Rod," After a three week stay in this light and airy garden studio, we were most reluctant to leave.  As well as the excellent location with good public transport, we enjoyed the peace and quiet of the back garden, and found the studio itself well equipped, functional, and spacious.  The open plan area was flooded with light on the dullest of days, and John, our host, was helpful and very friendly, with advice on a range of subjects.  "
58506,22287386,2022-02-08,4194055,Patricia,"John made good contact with us and gave us a warm welcome. We found the area very quiet and safe with the convenience of a nearby Bus 243 to the city or many services from Military Road.
<br/>The space is as described and more than adequate for a family or group of four. We slept soundly on a very comfortable bed after lovely hot showers. 
<br/>John suggested the Mosman Rowers Club which we included on the Cremorne Point-Mosman Wharf (Website hidden by Airbnb) absolute must for everyone. Bus to city, ferry to Cremorne Point, walk to the Light House right along Sydney Harbour then back to Mosman Wharf to have a delectable, reasonably priced lunch/drinks on the balcony at the (Website hidden by Airbnb) not miss the detour to the Elephant Ear garden! Then a ferry back to Circular Quay. 
<br/>Thank you John

<br/>The apartment is a good size, with heaps of space and well provided for, with a lovely garden too. The location is residential and the buses do work well, but if you don't want to use public transport then you would probably prefer to have a car if staying here.

<br/>The studio was as described and seen in the pictures. We were arriving late, but John had provided all the arrival information clearly and in good time.
<br/>The facilities are ample and everything is in good working order and very clean.
<br/>As John had a spare day for clearing up, he allowed us to check out late on our last day which was great as we could go straight to the airport.
<br/>I would recommend anyone to stay at Studio Yindi and if in the area again, I would stay at Studio Yindi again."
58506,27775159,2022-02-08,28353108,Chanin,"John is the first host i booked on airbnb, and he made my experience so impressed. He explained about the house the location the neighborhood and asked me back to make sure that i still want to book the house. After he accepted the booking, he also sent me and email giving all information you needed. I don't even need to ask. Everything is provided as the description. The house looks exact the same as shown in the photos. There also a small surfboard provided which i took to the beach with me and had a lot of fun. John also came and greeted us when he had time. The location of the house is also good just 15 minutes drive from the city, very close. One problem that one of my friends said was sometimes you can heard the noise from upstairs but for me was not a big deal. Overall i was very happy about the house. Thank you, John for hosting us."
58506,26728572,2022-02-08,12111842,Anne Seneca,"Fin velkomst ved ankomst. Vi kom før lejligheden skulle være klar men John var meget gæstfri og tilbød at vi kunne være i hans hus indtil lejligheden var klar.

58506,25626171,2022-02-08,4836995,Nikki,"Communication with John before and during our stay was excellent. He would always check if everything was okay.
<br/>The studio is exactly as described as are the photo's (I reckon it looks bigger in reality) and all the information John gives about (public) transport, sights etc. 
<br/>The bus stop just up the road was excellent for my mum (not too much walking) and takes you straight to Wynyard station where you can continue your trip from there. Apart from the city, we enjoyed cremorne point and a beer at the rowers. 
<br/>Our stay in Sydney was everything we hoped for and more.
<br/>Would definitely recommend studio Hindi and love to come again!"

It really is the perfect Airbnb, everything you could possibly need is provided, right down to nice olive oil and balsamic. We were there during a a cold snap and John made sure we had extra bedding. They even provided a little chair and table for our four year old to sit and draw. The place has stunning leafy views and a really welcoming feel. We hope to stay again! Thank you!"
58506,635823039049703364,2022-06-06,301739915,Maria Ysabel,Awesome hosts and a beautiful + affordable venue! Close to the venue and shops; lovely for a quick Sydney trip or a family vacation. John and Pam always made sure everything was alright and that we felt right at home (but better)!

The layout of the entire house is meant to provide the utmost flexibility for anyone to fit in perfectly, both for short and long-term stays.<br/><br/>I particularly loved the full glass doors and windows at the front of the house overlooking the small backyard! Although the TV could be slightly bigger, everything else was set up for anyone travelling both in winter or in the hotter months.<br/><br/>John himself was extremely communicative and responsive to every single query that I had, even coming down to meet us (he lives on the 2nd floor) and providing recommendations for local attractions. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet and beautiful house to live in Mosman, Sydney!"

58506,769776502258539340,2022-12-10,34895637,Jessica,"Studio Yindi provided a peaceful base for a family reunion.  Although it looks tiny on the AirBnb website, it is surprisingly roomy, and had everything we needed. John and Pamela could not have been more helpful and flexible to our needs.  We felt completely at home.  <br/>There is parking for a car on the street, and it is a short walk (although uphill in one direction) to the bus for the City, and all other points."
58506,774198278084841483,2022-12-10,5076840,Nick,"My family (wife and two children) stayed here for a week while we were in Mosman for a wedding. John was amazing at communicating, he even endeavoured to look for a babysitter for us, as we had no contacts in Sydney. <br/>The space is way bigger than the photos suggest, our kids loved the bunk and toys that were there. <br/>I went to a few other Airbnbs in Mosman during the week and this was by far the best value and our visitors who came for tea loved our little garden with a glimpse of the sea. <br/><br/>Staying here feels like staying at a family friends house. It’s not glam, but you are at ease with how welcome and comfortable you feel. <br/><br/>There were a few cons- there is a lot of construction noise coming from the renovation next door. We were out all the time so it didn’t bother us. <br/><br/>Overall it’s value for money and couldn’t rate John’s responsiveness and attention to us more highly."
58506,768424236178904406,2022-12-10,47818976,Casey&Maria,"Studio Yeti, has  all the basic things you need, it is like being at home away from home. It is a beautiful sized studio for a family of four. Our children loved the bunk beds, and the outside yard, though small it has a beautiful view with so many beautiful trees. We have stayed in a few Airbnb's and this one is definitely one of our favourites. The location is perfect! for getting to see Sydney's best.  Also, a great Playground for small children, like ours, is just 5 minute walk away from John and Pam's place, and there are some great restaurants and take out places we discovered. John and Pam were also great hosts! very friendly,  and kind, and got back to us quickly when messaging them. Thank you again John  and Pam for a great weekend getaway!  We will definitely recommend Studio Yeti.  :)"

We couldn't help but notice the same colourful parrot feasting on a bottlebrush tree over the 4 days we were there.<br/><br/>Location wise, it's in a peaceful part of Mosman yet still within driving distance to railway stations and walking distance to bus stops. There are also supermarkets, cafes and restaurants a short drive away.<br/><br/>John and Pam were great hosts who greeted us when we arrived. They also left plenty of pamphlets and guides which we found very useful.<br/><br/>All in all we had a very pleasant stay at Studio Yindi. Thanks John and Pam!"

The space was bigger than I expected from the photos, nice little grass area outside and a leafy outlook through all the glass panels while still being private. <br/>You can hear the day to day activity in the house above, just something to note if you are a light sleeper. <br/>we stayed for a wedding nearby and was a great base to have."

The studio is very spacious and comfortable. Fully equipped kitchen and study area where we could set up our laptop. Lovely location, close to shops and public transport. We caught an Uber to Mosman Bay Wharf (for $10) and traveled around Sydney by ferry. John is a lovely host with great communication and provided lots of information about the area. Up there as one of the best Air b n b’s we’ve stayed in. Won’t hesitate to book again when travelling to Sydney."

Parking can be challenging near local shops & restaurants. Lovely garden, the studio looks on to the garden. No street noise, very quiet. A few stairs to studio, requiring careful navigation at night."

The kitchen was well equipped and we could cook too and wash our clothes. Pam was nice to came out to look for us when we couldn’t find parking when we arrived due to nearby renovations. Appreciate the nice gesture. Love the location as there are supermarkets, cafe just a short drive away and Taronga Zoo is also a close by."

58506,1006833369437370579,2023-11-10,450970526,Myoungjun,"Even though it was my first time visiting Australia, I felt comfortable and received complete explanations.  John's guidance was always friendly and detailed.  The accommodation was more than I dreamed of.  <br/>The garden was beautiful and fragrant.  The sunlight shining into the living room is warm and comfortable.  The bed is comfortable and clean.  The kitchen is clean and has many things prepared.  <br/>My family and I had a perfect trip to Sydney thanks to John."

58506,1035769535799500489,2023-12-12,23099697,Andrew,"Highly recommended.<br/>Great spot, excellent communication, the kids were happy and we could relax. Good kitchen, comfy bed. Nice view out big windows.<br/>You'll need a car, but everything else is just a short drive away."
58506,1032978469409322121,2023-12-12,27515108,Geoffrey,John's place is in a super quiet street with easy parking on the street. John was very accommodating with a late check-in and left the door open and lights on. The place is very clean and lovely garden view.
58506,1027840405059387417,2023-12-12,432021965,Narelle,"Great Airbnb with super friendly hosts, full equipped kichen and an amazing smelling garden.<br/>We absolutely recommend it for travelers. Mosman is an family friendly district and there is an busstop 100 meter from the Airbnb."
58506,1090132798491554712,2024-03-16,169797651,국희,감사합니다! 주변에서 모스만에 머문다고 하니 걱정을 많이 했어요. 시내랑 멀다고 불편할거라고 했지만 전혀 불편하지 않았어요. 진짜 시드니의 모습을 더 많이 볼 수 있었고 너무 훌륭한 숙소였습니다. 강추드립니다! 하지만 짧은 일정을 오시는 분 중에 유명 관광지 위주로 가시고 싶으시다면 조금 힘들 수 있습니다. 하지만 저는 그 이상의 가치가 있다고 생각해서 아주 잘한 선택이었어요. 좋은 숙소를 제공해주셔서 감사합니다. 아주이른 새벽이나 밤늦은 시간에 이동하는 것이 아니라면 코앞으로 버스가 옵니다 ^^
58506,1111196290211056784,2024-03-16,33813885,Graham,Extremely roomy & quiet.  Hosts were friendly & helpful.
58506,1108323101560953162,2024-03-16,111576510,Susanne,"Everything we needed was zvailable for our 7 day stay. The Amazing bus service 2 min walk away takes you directly into Sydney central in about 20 mins. From the main road zbout a w0 minute walk away there ate many more bus options eg. direct to Manley. Incredible location for getting about- but at first glance it looks 'to far out'.<br/>John was very helpful and very pleasant when we bumped into him. He gave us lots of useful tips, even fixed my shoe! This place is great as it has a lovely garden and comfortable chairs and table to sit out."
58506,1084436807443165796,2024-03-16,24273690,Jisu,Spacious place with a beautiful garden. It was a pleasure to stay at this house.
58506,1080762123574781623,2024-03-16,524030047,Lillian,"John was fantastic! He was super welcoming and accommodating. <br/>He greeted us when we first arrived and even organised for us to leave our luggage at the place before our official check in. <br/>He also organised a late check-out for us and offered to hold our luggage during the day as our flight was later at night. <br/>Everything was super clean, especially the bathroom! Lots of things provided such as soap, milk, wine etc. There were even puzzles and books provided (which we had lots of fun with).<br/>We felt right at home and I can’t recommend this place enough! It’s a little out of the city but perfect as it’s very quiet and private other than the early morning kookaburras! <br/>Thanks again John 🥰"

Le studio est extrêmement bien conçu, bien plus grand qu'il n'y paraît, propre, avec de nombreux jouets pour les enfants. <br/>John et Pamela ont été adorables tout au long de notre séjour, et plein de petites attentions pour nos filles.<br/>Un super Airbnb !"

58506,1124298700983501730,2024-04-17,81534538,Sandra,Thank you for a wonderful stay. Great location and amazing view. We enjoyed meeting Kevin the kookaburra as well.
58506,1129307870686037235,2024-04-17,216683228,Marc,"StudioYindi is an ideal spot for a small family. The studio itself is spacious, and the outdoor area adds to its charm, providing a refreshing retreat after a day of exploring Sydney. Balmoral Beach, captivated us with its beauty. It's accessible on foot, but there's also a bus option available.<br/>John and Pam were outstanding hosts! Their warmth and helpfulness exceeded our expectations. They generously shared recommendations for places to visit in Sydney and took the time to explain the Opal card and the city's public transport system. Our stay at StudioYindi was delightful, made even more memorable by the sightings of local kookaburras, Kevin and Katie. Thank you, John and Pam, for your hospitality!"
58506,1120630591695663776,2024-04-17,523410200,Matthew,"It's a really lovely place to stay if you don't want to be in the hustle & bustle of Sydney. Really quiet, apart from the sound of the frogs at night and the kookaburras in the morning, which makes it feel like you're well out of the city and yet it's only a short bus ride to the CBD. You also have Taronga zoo close by, and the North shore beaches are significantly quieter and, arguably, better for the children than the more famous Bondi. <br/>Jon and Pam are really helpful with advice on how to get round and places to go, as well as being attentive hosts. Jon brought round a bodyboard for our daughter to use when we went to the beach and let her help feed a couple of kookaburras that come expecting to be fed, which she was really charmed by.<br/>My only criticism would be the topography of the area which, if you're from the flatlands like us, can feel like climbing the North face of the Eiger just to get into the town, let alone getting back from the beach. Good job there's a bus stop nearby."
58506,1109699706120685923,2024-04-17,91249978,Shannon,"John and Pam have put together a well equipped studio with most things considered for a really enjoyable stay. We especially enjoyed the kid friendly aspects. We found John helpful with local tips and very friendly throughout our stay. This was a perfect location for easy access to Taronga Zoo and Balmoral Beach. Thanks for having us. Our daughter was really happy in your space, which meant we were too."

Sitting down at this beautiful lounge watching and listening local birds singing - I don’t need to go anywhere ! This is truly an amazing place and I am super lucky to find here. <br/>John and Pamela are kind, caring ,friendly, informative and experienced hosts that gave us a super relaxing time on our trip. <br/>The place has everything you need and hosts are super responsive and helpful. I feel like that I don’t want to leave! <br/>My big thank you to John and Pamela for my lovely and memorable experience in Mosman Australia! <br/>We would love to come back !"
