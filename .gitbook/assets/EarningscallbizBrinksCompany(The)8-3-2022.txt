continue to recover

operating profit without twelve percent with organic profit growth of seventeen percent and acquisition related growth of one percent partially offset by six percent negative impact from fx this profit growth was driven by strong your of a year margin expansion in three of four for geographic segments the exception with north america were profits decline vs last year's very strong second quarter which benefited from several one time adjustments way to various insurance credits bad debt reversals and covert related government subsidies that on combined basis more than offset the second quarter margin improve it this year on a sequential basis and twenty twenty two the north american margin rate increase by a hundred ninety basis points over the first quarter rate and we expect further improvement in the second half in north america or price increases continue to outpace our labor and other costs increases and labour availability continues to improve adjusted he but i was at thirteen percent company wide and seventeen percent in constant currency with a margin of sixteen point four percent up sixty basis points over prior year i'll mail from the call over iran who cover these results in more detail

ron thanks mark and good day every one turning the slide five as marches mentioned two thousand and twenty two second quarter revenue sources prior year was up thirteen percent in constant currency almost entirely from organic growth foreign exchange had some significant swing throughout the quarter while the euro devalued twelve percent other currencies such as the mexican peso and brazilian riyadh are not as negative in in aggregate fx was a five percent headwind reporter revenue was one billion one hundred and thirty four million dollars of eighty five million or eight percent first as the second quarter last year second quarter operating profit and constant currency was at eighteen percent versus last year organic growth was seventeen percent and acquisitions added another one percent negative for x was six million dollars reported operating profit was one hundred and twenty four million dollars and the operating profit margin of ten point nine percent was up forty bits versus the second quarter two thousand and twenty one moving applied six second quarter interest expense was thirty two million dollars up four million versus the same period last year to the higher debt associated with the two hundred million dollars and share repurchases completed in the last twelve months and higher variable interest rates tax expense in the corner with thirty one million dollars in line with last year as higher income was mostly offset by a hundred and ten bit reduction in the effective tax rate one hundred and twenty four million dollars of second quarter two thousand and twenty two operating profit less interest expense taxes and one million and non controlling interest in other generated sixty two million of income from continuing operations

this equates to a dollar and twenty nine cents of earnings per share of twelve percent on a reported basis and up thirty percent excluding the mark to market game on the moneygram shares we held last year

share repurchases reduced are weighted average deluded shares outstanding by two point nine million shares vs prior year or about six percent and accounted for about six cents increase in p second quarter two thousand and twenty two adjusted ebitda was one hundred and eighty seven million dollars or twenty one million or plus thirteen percent versus a strong quarter last year and is mark mentioned he done as a percent of revenue was sixteen point four percent up sixty bibs versus the sec can quarter two thousand and twenty one turning a free cash flow on slide seven or two thousand and twenty two free cash flow range is unchanged from last quarter it is estimated between two hundred and eighty and three hundred and fifteen million dollars projected free cash flow is seventy seven million higher when adjusted for sixty seven million dollars and third quarter two thousand and twenty two hedge mana decision which i'll discuss more in a moment and ten million dollars in two thousand and twenty payroll taxes that were deferred due to the pandemic adjusted ebitda is expected to range between seven hundred and fifty five and seven hundred ninety million dollars and at the midpoint would be about ninety million more than last year we expect use that seven million in cash for working capital restructuring and a ten million and deferred tax payments the taxes are estimated to be one hundred and ten million dollars up twenty six million versus last year due mostly to higher income as well as the timing of payments in response cat interest is expected around one hundred and fifteen million dollars an increase of nine million versus two thousand and twenty one to the incremental debt associated with the previously mentioned share repurchases the p i acquisition their clothes on april one last year and higher variable interest rates net cash tax is targeted at one hundred and eighty million two thousand and twenty two free cash flow conversion ratio is targeted to be about forty percent of adjusted ebitda and equates to approximately six dollars and fifteen cents per share to fly days this slide illustrates are actual net debt and financial leverage at year and two thousand and twenty one at the end of the first half of two thousand and twenty two and our estimate for year end two thousand and twenty two there was a one hundred and sixty five million dollar increase in that debt from year and two thousand and twenty one to june thirty two thousand and twenty two about half of that increase with due to a first quarter change in mexico invoicing regulations that is temporarily increased accounts receivable and the balance with due to revenue growth and normal seasonality we expect mexico dsl to return to normal by year end the approximate one hundred eighty million dollar decrease in that debt from your and two thousand and twenty one to two thousand and twenty two is expected to be driven by free cash flow and sixty seven million dollars in third quarter two thousand and twenty two hedge monetization partly offset by dividends financing leases and other strategy to point out device investment so we have authorization for another two hundred and fifty million dollars and share repurchases nothing has been built into this estimate dividing are estimated two point one billion dollar two thousand and twenty two year and net debt by the midpoint of are expected either would range should generate a net debt leverage ratio of two point seven turns our credit facility has a covenant face on net secured leverage with the ratio maximum of three point five term for the half turn increase if there's a material acquisition or two thousand and twenty one secured leverage ratio with two point zero turn we expect that to decline to one point five to one point six times by the end of two thousand and twenty two the only other credit facility financial covenant his interest average which must exceed three times we have considerable room with both covenants even an economic downturn moving to our debt maturity profile on slide nine in the second quarter two thousand and twenty two we amended and extended our credit facility through we retained a billion dollar revolving credit facility and we expanded our term loan a by two hundred million dollars to one point four billion he amended facility reduced our used pricing grid by twenty five bibs and is expected to provide significant interest expense savings going forward maturity was extended out five years and meaningfully expanded our capacity to make restricted payments including share repurchases on this slide the like gray bars reflect our debt maturity before the men and extend in the dark blue bars afterwards or five point five percent senior notes but you were in july two thousand and twenty five and otherwise we had no material that retirement obligations until two thousand and twenty seven as i mentioned earlier in july we monetize across currency interest rate swap on our four hundred million dollar five point five percent senior know we received sixty seven million in cash and entered into new swaps to had similar exposure going forward

the cast proceeds reduce our net debt and associated leverage in increase our capital allocation flexibility with that are handed back tomorrow thanks run is i mentioned at the outset are strong second quarter results were achieved in a challenge and macro economic environment like most companies prince is not immune to these challenges however we firmly believe that we are better position than most do the fact that the services we provide are critical to our customers and remain a central through our economic cycles or largest cost by far as labor and we are continuing to offset rising wages with discipline pricing actions as previously discussed in private quarters we implemented several price increases in our us business that went into effect in the latter part of twenty twenty one and the first half of twenty twenty two both of which were well above our historical averages be frightened actions have positioned us to more than offset labor cost increases in the current quarter and as image outta year we expect price in actions to continue to offset inflationary pressures both here and the us and around the world as a service business with locally sourced people in assets we are far less vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions in many others industrial service businesses and were necessary we secured long term partnerships with global suppliers and made early purchases to avoid any potential disruptions right if costs have also historically not had a material impact our profitability as most of our customer agreements have fuel surcharge clauses we have a track record of relative stability during recessions and other times of crisis due to an increase in cash usage and security concerns

this history combined with proactive price in actions and are operational excellence initiatives gives us confidence that we will sustain a recent momentum and achieve our for your guidance

moving onto the next flight we're also great started twenty twenty two and on track to achieve revenue growth of eight to eleven percent or for your guidance provided the beginning of the year was based on fx rate at the end of last year since then we've seen significant strengthener the us dollar especially against the euro based on current rates versus last year we expect to see some continued fx headwinds and second out despite these effects moves which resulted in a five percent unfavorable impact in the quarter we still delivered record results we're also on track to achieve operating profit growth of sixteen to twenty three percent reflecting a margin increase of approximately one hundred basis points vs last year and we also expect to deliver double digit increases a bit off free cash flow and earnings per share it's important to note that while revenue has now recovered to one hundred percent of pro forma twenty nineteen prepared dimmick levels are full your twenty twenty two revenue guidance exceeds or twenty nineteen reported revenue by close to a billion dollars and are operating margin is expected to expand by a hundred and fifty basis points over the same period in other words today's breaks is far larger and far more profitable than it's ever been which this to discipline execution of a balanced growth strategy focus on both organic improvements and a creative acquisitions we plan to drive additional organic growth and margin expansions continuing to build a strong culture of continuous improvement and customer focus by leveraging six cost reductions as volume grows by aggressively managing our price cost equation and by further streamline or operations on the him in a front with demonstrate our ability to buy good assets integrate them effectively an improved the business mix with access to new markets and service offerings for does your perspective it's also important to note that are three your targets are driven primarily by growth and continued operational improvements in our core business which accounts for approximately ninety percent of our twenty twenty four revenue targets and eighty five percent of our operating profit target

conversely our new eighty i managed services and brings complete initiative combined to account for about ten percent of our twenty twenty four revenue targets and fifteen percent of our operating profits or

given our strong start to the year the resiliency of our business and challenges environments the ongoing reopening of global economies and with our growth in productivity initiatives i'm confident that will deliver a financial targets now let's open it up or questions we will now begin the question and answer session to ask questions he meets a star and was on your touched on some if you're using a speakerphone pick up your hands full facilities if it any time your question has been addressed and he would like to withdraw your questions faster started to at the time will cause military to assemble our asses

the first lesson today some some it's toby summer with to securities this dilemma

fig warning since jasper melbourne for toby thanks for taking our questions says was hoping you could update us on the brakes complete deployments and and how the sales acts of these tracking their relatives here to or expectations yes your yeah for good morning

yep keep continuing to to progress as planned and in are still continuing to to see more customer interest in a total solution versus the traditional see id services and we talked about it last quarter

globally our tech enabled solutions that includes or breaks complete offering you grew by more than twenty percent of the prior years and in in the corner this we saw grow over twenty eight percent so continuing accelerating growth in the us alone as we mentioned that represented over twenty percent of

our our revenue into one now that's pushing up towards twenty six percent so you're really seen the kind of penetration we would expect a of course listen that the the economy still in in transition certainly as the looming recessions retail at walk

continues to see some bumpy reports out there from some of the big retailers here we are seen in person retail or continuing to accelerate with you seen the numbers but i'm sure many have about the transition from online shopping back to you in person which of course favors

cash usage where would we still represent almost a third of of all the payments for in person charges i think the other thing that's also changing in that as in that environment is as you look at and people start to get squeezed and household incomes are are being challenged with inflation

you're starting to see more people more discount buyers more discount retailers are having success again smaller transaction small purchases which again lend themselves towards more cash transaction so obvious that that are supporting both the interest not only in our core business but in are you know

more technology enable offerings would bring simply

thanks and then just one of ask about that the high value services business what's been the slope of recovery for your foreign exchange services given what seems to be a a relatively strong summer travel season so far

yeah ios just what we certainly saw you know he of that business subside and and now in some cases retracts significantly during the pandemic and and as you can imagine it in their hi guys are necessary for us and our global services business we saw a shift toward more precious metals we're moving around the globe and you know we're actually a large player in that market but as we've seen things are shipped back to travel we have seen more banknote movements now certainly that is to do to effects and due to travel which you know seen some of the the euro control data that's out there that tories and continues to recover travelers continue recover particularly into europe but we're still seeing you know southeast asia still slow to with recover although our segment results in a continue to improve in that region

but still there's there's still some some recovery going on i think the the other thing of note

is that

the fx markets

between central banks and governments obviously has been volatile which also drives

have quite a bit of fake know transmission globally

gotta nudges you mention a relative weakness weakness in in asia pack with the rest of world segment overall it's to be strong here so what are some the markets that might be lagging on or else the basis for stand over a signature hong kong and macau i think you know continue to have to friends some pretty significant restrictions relative travel in and out which is odyssey restricted

not only tourism but but business commerce in gaming industry seen quite a bit of your fits and starts in macau certainly which again is a big traveler area in a market we serve the of the other big markets the that we serve singapore malaysia philippines

continue to exit there

you know their pandemic restrictions and are gaining momentum

you know at each month as we go through the summer season

last question for me it was just and some media reports about a large potential three que los on a high value shipment in california

yeah just clarify how you're approaching that side them in your guidance yeah sure he knows his dismay maybe just to clarify

clarify the

what happened and and maybe all over the media reports and sentence later the record straight from our side your the other the robbery don't we all watched on our investigation we're not going to us we can't comment on the specifics of what happened to the details for can say is that the amount

of the last would speak less than ten million dollars

you know at the at the worst case and that's contrary to some fairly salacious media reports out there and you know hundred and fifty million dollars or want to make sure that

the debt clear are guidance you know

on an ongoing basis routinely includes estimates for losses as is this is part of part of our business we use historical data to do that

and while this is qualified in and resort in the media the impact of on this last should not be material to our results

pacific our their thanks for taking questions guess your

the next question telescope until it's tom waits goldman sachs

i think the morning and did you talk a little bit about what macro assumptions your including in guidance in in high you're expecting see the economy to impact performance in the second half of the year

yeah georgia i think we've we're

we're not building in any significance contract and in our business in fact we're not seeing any slowing in can velocity of our business

the results we have you know so far has been as we expected and as i mentioned in the in the prepared remarks

historically even with recessions whether it's a technical recession or a mild recession or you know maybe something more protracted know which we tend to to be really resilient people tend to return to cash in many cases and with more cash use becomes your for us more you're not only north no more volume but more opportunity

for attracting new customers so that i that sort of the us the macro view on the recession we don't have any

mean large step function changes built and of course meals and we're not cooperate the business you know

flexibly and in make adjustments either way but we're not nothing big in front of us that we seen or are hearing from our customers in fact whether it be retailers or our financial institution partners got it that's awful and it would suspect margins on to discuss some the latest initiatives you have that you're deploying to continue to close the gap

or it may be done margins relative to tears and when you might expect that gap of the medium term to close

sure a week george with us and we we on

feel very good about you know where our guidance is right now this in our our we are three your targets we laid out at a hundred basis points a year we we expect that to continue and have line of sight to that this year as as we've had built into our our guidance in the first year in don't see us coming off of that oh that the only thing i would say is you don't listen we have we have a mix of businesses around the globe that have different margins and you know are you at our north american business particularly as one that we know is and recognized has lagged some of our peers that's something that we're we're addressing directly and in are already starting to see your fruits of the of those improve activities we've we've also recently made and and announced at the leadership change their

danny castillo leads are north american segment

you know a seasoned executives gonna that really gonna be able to already identify some of the areas of improvement that

maybe we'd be recognized but but certainly now are are taken action on and i think this is something we expect to construct continuous improvement quarter to quarter we saw

good improvement quarter to wonderful to already about twenty or twenty eight percent sequential earnings leveraged out a few wanted to start the year and expect you know if you look forward in our results from prayer it listen expected to continue deliver yeah good improvements quarter on quarter after the rest of the year diseases again in an area that will obviously help not only as one of the largest segment that will help us you're close the gap in in a significant way and a disproportionate weights not just in north america but you know on the global portfolio and again as i think about peers at the on the i don't think just about peers

in

you know in the logistics space we think about peers

across all investment categories and this you where are competing for investors is against the appears and we think that are our growth rates rose in are you to die and free gas flow you know comparison with any
