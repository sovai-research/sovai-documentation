My own preferences are for adventure and off the beaten track, rather than luxury, international 5 star.

We became Airbnb.com hosts back in December 2010.   I was originally an architect, but worked in IT sales/marketing for the next 30+ years.  Semi-retired now,  I still manage consulting projects involving the Internet for small-medium businesses and some community based campaigns to promote better planning outcomes for the whole community, not just developers and their “top end of town” mates.

I call myself an Internet Architect on my business card these days.  Most of my current projects involve marketing using social media tools.

A born and bred Sydneysider, I lived in UK for 10 years till 1984.  I have done lots of travel in Europe, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, Vietnam, Japan, New Zealand, USA. 

Studio Yindi incorporates the things we look for when selecting boutique hotels, pensions, hostels and B&Bs for ourselves - space, privacy, wifi Internet access, reading light at the bedside, comfortable and practical for working while ""on the road"", a bit unusual, a little surprise, and value for money. 

My own preferences are for adventure and off the beaten track, rather than luxury, international 5 star. 

We love meeting travellers from all parts of the world, and helping them enjoy the experience of a first visit to Sydney.

We have lots of experience assisting overseas based friends and colleagues to see the best parts of Sydney, using public transport, and avoiding the expensive tourist services.
