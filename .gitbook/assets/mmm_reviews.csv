My particular manager seemed to never be there, so working flex hours was not an issue, but can't speak to other teams. The work load was not too extensive for me, but that may have been due to the in-fighting across teams that allowed very little to get assigned and done.  They had a decent web mail client, which, given managers' propensity to answer and send all emails after 8pm was a life saver.","I would not know where to start here. Most employees have been there for 10-20+ years, so this particular division did not take kindly to outsiders. The in-fighting between teams was so extensive that I was given a list of people to ""not respond to via email or phone."" I was also told not to attend meetings without approval from my manager to ensure my expertise was not ""stolen"" by ""the enemy."" Yuck. I was closed off from projects I offered the most seasoned expertise in, due to senior leadership very much disliking each other. It was disappointing to not get to leverage my expertise in an arena that so badly needed it, and the constant back-stabbing and bad-mouthing of co-workers that started on day one and never stopped made me very uncomfortable. Also, I was constantly asked to tap my network of digital vendors, agencies and resources to produce RFPs or work for 3M at the 11th hour that never went anywhere. Great way to ruin long-standing working relationships outside of the company.  I was not aware of anyone who seemed ""happy"" working there compared to other companies I have worked for. No one smiled, ever. 

I finally had to start working on projects without telling my manager just to ensure I was doing anything at all and that I was helping them from spending way too much for way too little or just simply doing something not aligned with their audience/customer needs. 

From a sheer ""company"" perspective, the oddities at 3M Healthcare were endless. There were no refrigerators for employees to store lunch, beverages, etc. It may not sound like a big deal - try it sometime. The lunchroom was open very briefly every day, and offered the worst, most unhealthy and expensive selection of food (if you got there in time to get any) I have ever seen, anywhere. To avoid waste, they provided less food than needed, and anything edible was gone immediately. There's nothing but fast food around there, so going off-site was not a better option. I spent my first three days literally sitting in an empty cube with no computer (which can be typical) but also with nothing to read, ramp-up on, or anyone coming by to say hello or get me situated, manager included. I had to train myself on all systems and getting logins to do so was far more frustrating and time-consuming than usual. The commute is horrid, too, unless you live out that way. 

There was no discernible process to anything, and trying to instill any was futile. I had to ask folks many times for things they'd promised to deliver, to little avail. I never really knew what I was supposed to be working on, what would come up as ""due"" at any time, or what would be summarily cancelled or taken off my plate - all of this was due to politics. I spent more time in meetings about projects that never moved forward (or that at least our team was ""kicked off of"") than in meetings about viable projects. 

I attempted to address all of these issues over and over, to no result, and ended up having to print and save the nasty emails between teams their managers to ensure I was never ""blamed"" for something I was not involved in. Not fun. 

It might be fine for folks that have been there forever, and other divisions may be more advanced in their collaboration and politicking skills not to mention digital savvy.

Good cafeteria - catered food for south plant, grill/salad bar for north plant","Very poor work/life balance.  You are expected to work when they want you to.  Work scheduling can change depending on ""business needs!""  Expect anything from rotating shift work days-afternoons-nights, to alternating 12's going from days to nights twice per week.  They claim to be ""health oriented"" but fail when it comes to understanding health consequences of alternating days/nights and lots of overtime. 

Mandatory overtime often means long stretches of work without a day off, but this depends on the area and time of year. 

Do not be expect to be recognized for achievements.  The smallest policy violations can lead to poor reviews which inhibit your ability to advance and there is no appeals process that represents the employee.  If you disagree with management decisions, an HR rep is assigned to represent you in the process and you are not allowed to attend the appeals decision meetings to speak for yourself.  Input from supervisors and managers take precedence over that of employees.  The investigation process is extremely biased toward management and does not function objectively.

-No career growth opportunities whatsoever. If you have a PhD, this is a dead end. You don't get to do real research nor do you get to implement things the way you envision. Your manager tells you what to do and how to do, without knowing any basics mind you. You basically become a software engineer.

-Your contribution is not recognized. 

-You spend time in meetings every day to report every single thing you did the previous day. Its called stand-ups apparently. Is this elementary school or what?

-You have managers who are technically not informed. You are managed by fools who know nothing about the technical stuff but are good at talking the talk. You are told to apply machine learning for problems that don't need machine learning. 

-The current president is a real joke.

-If you're a company that gets acquired by 3M, just run, leave as fast as you can. 3M will suck the culture you've come to enjoy out and will drain any joy you had working there.

Depending on which department you may work in your shift constantly changes.  The last department I was in we rotated shifts every week.  1 week of days, then evenings and then grave yard.  I knew what I was getting into when I applied but the OT board is what kills you.  It's easy enough, if you want OT then you sign the board and if you don't then you don't sign.  However there is a accumulative point system that records the number of OT hours offered vs worked.  So if no one signs the board whoever has the lowest # of worked hours has to do it regardless of whatever plans you may have for when you get off work.  You don't find out if you have to work until your 1/2 way through the shift.  It's hard to plan things when your not sure if you will have to work or not.  Also they have a point system in regards to punishment.  The system escalates from 1-5.  No big deal.  However one of the most insane things I've ever encountered is being punished for being sick.

Because the company is so large and diversified, there are a lot of opportunities to work in different industries and in different roles. Average tenure at 3M is incredibly long (it's not uncommon for employees to have 30+ years at 3M) which I think speaks to the ability to have a career with a lot of variety all at one company. Additionally, there is a strong culture of learning and development. There are constantly seminars and forums for employees to engage in continuous learning and there is generally an enthusiasm around collaboration and continuous improvement.","3M is largely behind other local Fortune 500 companies in terms of benefits for working parents. If you are thinking about  accepting a position at 3M and have a family or are considering starting a family in the next 5 years, I would strongly encourage you to discern whether or not you have the financial means to take an unpaid FMLA and/or use all of your vacation time for parenting leave. For maternity leave, you are eligible for 6 - 8 weeks (depending on the type of delivery) of short term disability and any additional time must be taken unpaid. The short term disability benefit varies by years of service, but for most people I know around the office who are expecting they will receive one week of full pay (provided they don't use any sick days in the last 12 months) and 60% pay for the 6-8 weeks. Any leave a new mother wants to take beyond that is unpaid. In the worst case, if a woman must go on bedrest before leave, her family stands to take a huge financial hit. For paternity leave, the official policy of 3m is that one day can be used for the day of the birth. If a father would like to take parenting leave, he can either use vacation or take FMLA unpaid. These policies are in stark contrast to what other local Fortune 500 companies offer (Target recently announced two weeks paid paternity leave and has updated their maternity leave benefits for 2016, Thomson Reuters has 12 weeks paid for maternity and 2 weeks for paternity, UnitedHealth Group also offers 12 weeks paid for maternity leave,  Best Buy offers 5 weeks paid for maternity). Additionally, only two weeks of paid vacation is offered to new employees in contrast to other competitors that offer three weeks (Boston Scientific, Target, TR, UnitedHealth Group). Lastly, despite a corporate initiative called ""Flex-Ability"", working from home is still a faux pax and you need to convince supervisors that it can be more productive and often essential to balance the needs of work and home. There is still a strong culture of ""butts in seats"". In an age where companies are acknowledging that employees are retained and more productive when they are able to balance their priorities at work and home, it seems short sighted that 3M likes to boast a competitive compensation package as well as a great company for women when its policies so clearly state the opposite.",,2015-12-07,1,0,0,0,0,1,2.6666666666666665,2.62009447530486,2.0458333188586297,4.393498783207681,3.1524171619603467,2.8475828380396533,3.7607738535153996,3.493012729807477,4.267099766584197,3.419280461309425,1.618725733577728,3.45318358831896,2.733861798848386,2.8260175142823987,2.2091847535909093,1.0205376146820715,1.0024771053785817,4.889040309936367,pay competitive workload manageable company large diversified lot opportunity work different industry different role average tenure incredibly long uncommon employee year think speaks ability career lot variety one company additionally strong culture learning development constantly seminar forum employee engage continuous learning generally enthusiasm around collaboration continuous improvement,largely behind local fortune company term benefit working parent thinking accepting position family considering starting family next year would strongly encourage discern whether financial mean take unpaid fmla andor use vacation time parenting leave maternity leave eligible week depending type delivery short term disability additional time must taken unpaid short term disability benefit varies year service people know around office expecting receive one week full pay provided dont use sick day last month pay week leave new mother want take beyond unpaid worst case woman must go bedrest leave family stand take huge financial hit paternity leave official policy one day used day birth father would like take parenting leave either use vacation take fmla unpaid policy stark contrast local fortune company offer target recently announced two week paid paternity leave ha updated maternity leave benefit thomson reuters ha week paid maternity week paternity unitedhealth group also offer week paid maternity leave best buy offer week paid maternity additionally two week paid vacation offered new employee contrast competitor offer three week boston scientific target tr unitedhealth group lastly despite corporate initiative called flexability working home still faux pax need convince supervisor productive often essential balance need work home still strong culture butt seat age company acknowledging employee retained productive able balance priority work home seems short sighted like boast competitive compensation package well great company woman policy clearly state opposite,5,0

They are committed to quality and high performance.  3M as a company does a better job with employee training and technical education than any other place I've worked.  If you are willing to relocate there are many opportunities to advance within the organization at other 3M divisions,"Touch screens don't necessarily fit 3M's business model.  They are costly to produce and demand for the high-end systems 3M makes may not be great enough to sustain the business.  Although 3M does their best to keep a culture of innovation, they are a big manufacturing company and have lots of policies and procedures that promote caution, deliberation and avoiding mistakes at all costs.

3M likes to rotate its managers into different business groups.  As a result upper management at Touch Systems changed every couple years.  Each new manager would need to be educated in the realities of the business.  Frequently the new manager would have a grand (and unrealistic) vision for the business that he would try to implement.  This led to many false starts.

3M sets its salaries on the high end of average for similar large manufacturing companies.

-No opportunities to go to meetings, interact with managers, or have a lot of interaction with other departments
-Your experience is highly dependent on your boss(es) and building you work in. Many office spaces are depressing and many bosses are not a good fit for their interns. There are dozens of tech aide opportunities at 3M. Ask your future manager questions during your interview and make sure you want to commit to their projects.
-The actual work you do is menial. Tech Aide input on experimental design is limited. You will inevitably run tests, prep samples, and do the dirty work for the majority of your time at 3M. The pain of your workload is 100% dependent on your manager.
-3M hires tech aides because experimental tasks need to be completed. Instead of having Engineers run these tests, this work if off loaded to other employees if an engineer wants to more efficiently spend their time in meetings. Some choose to take this path, while others do their testing themselves. A lab technician would cost 3M too much money, so they choose high school and college students willing to work for poor wages. The pay is not really work the worth you have to do. Take a 3M tech aide job if you are a freshman/sophomore in need of a part time job and initial experience.

If you work at a manufacturing location you probably have a very different view.  Many of the perks available at the headquarters are non existent at a plant location.  Cost cutting measures generally impact the plant locations to a greater extent than corporate.  3M is quick to impose headcount and overtime restrictions at plants that cause significant pain for our customers when business is down across the company, even though it is still busy at the plant.  The are also quick to require excessive overtime when busy.  Plant managers are typically former engineers who have very little people skills and typically practice an authoritarian style of leadership.  3M has a very good overall reputation but there is a large disparity between working at the headquarters and working at a plant.  3M has a history of taking away benefits every year or increasing the cost of your benefits more than what the market is increasing.

I can assure you that this company cares about it's employees.  And whether or not it's apparent, cares tremendously about the environment, community and products it offers.
The pay is competitive, the flexibility is a tremendous perk and it's fun and exciting. (And ever-changing right now!)  
The different types of jobs you can have are equally as amazing.  Administrative assistant, production line assembly, project manager, software tester, project manager, Scrum master, security guard, quality assurance (testing of the products or programs), sales rep....the list goes on and on.  If you find you don't like what you do - stick it out for 2 years and transfer to something else.  All of my supervisors- with the exception of 1 - have ALWAYS worked with me to get me to my next step at the company.  
This is the place to have inspiration and aspirations - and be safe in knowing your work is appreciated.
They encourage you to volunteer.  They encourage you to get up out of your cube to take a walk.  They encourage you to seek a mentor to get you through your professional career.  Everyone I have encountered is more than happy to sit down with you and discuss your professional life and give you advice.","I'm a big believer that not all people can work at all companies.  To work at 3M, you have to be flexible.  Like - really flexible.  And you have to work in ambiguous circumstances at times.   If you're the type of person who always needs clear direction, probably not the best place for you.  
You have to NOT require constant supervision to get your job done.  If you're in a leadership position, you have to have confidence in what you're doing and the ability to speak up and step out in a crowd when you have an opinion, yet know when to sit back and listen (and take some advice too!)
You *will* have difficulties throughout your professional life - no matter what job you are in.  From a manager who doesn't manage you the right way, to not being recognized on a project that you worked hard at, to arrogant people, etc.  It's YOUR choice how you handle these things.  Step up!  Speak out!  It's welcome at 3M - and with a bit of work (managing up!) - you can train your boss for what you need as well :)
It's a big company - if you like small companies, this is not the place to work.  You will more than likely have to walk over 100 feet to get to your desk.
There are some that are still working in the ""old"" way - The ""good ol boys club"" - where you get promoted because you know them personally, etc.  My advice - speak up when you feel shunned, do your part, and find another job in 2 years if it's not working out where you are.  These are not deal breakers, but I can totally understand and appreciate difficulties through period of time.",,2019-03-18,1,1,1,0,0,3,4.666666666666667,2.115700782481713,2.0565643632942803,2.79703794895251,2.322706322876007,3.6772936771239935,2.2583744127612317,3.7981115933695135,4.010406062695985,3.5136458744974433,1.5271249641227955,4.4471553287945165,2.3286827019021974,2.087364784912376,2.262437749892567,1.0003501000784207,1.0007002485453027,1.0209990128317563,reason ive year assure company care employee whether apparent care tremendously environment community product offer pay competitive flexibility tremendous perk fun exciting everchanging right different type job equally amazing administrative assistant production line assembly project manager software tester project manager scrum master security guard quality assurance testing product program sale repthe list go find dont like stick year transfer something else supervisor exception always worked get next step company place inspiration aspiration safe knowing work appreciated encourage volunteer encourage get cube take walk encourage seek mentor get professional career everyone encountered happy sit discus professional life give advice,im big believer people work company work flexible like really flexible work ambiguous circumstance time youre type person always need clear direction probably best place require constant supervision get job done youre leadership position confidence youre ability speak step crowd opinion yet know sit back listen take advice difficulty throughout professional life matter job manager doesnt manage right way recognized project worked hard arrogant people etc choice handle thing step speak welcome bit work managing train bos need well big company like small company place work likely walk foot get desk still working old way good ol boy club get promoted know personally etc advice speak feel shunned part find another job year working deal breaker totally understand appreciate difficulty period time,5,2

The overall base pay is strong, they match 401(k) at varying percentages based on level, offer an employee stock purchase program with a 15% discount and have the standard yearly pay increases","The company is clearly focused on and centered around B2B. They do not understand consumer driven businesses and do not adopt their business models and practices accordingly.  If you come from a consumer based company, you will be very disappointed.  Marketing budgets are consistently the first area to be cut and the company spends at approximately 1/3 of what other traditional CPG companies spend on marketing.   They very  much adopt the mindset of 'if you build a better mousetrap'.  

The company freely moves people in to roles where they have no experience or expertise.  While I can appreciate the willingness to allow people to move freely within the company, they assign people to roles based on tenure, not experience or expertise.   People with supply chain backgrounds run marketing, customer service backgrounds run sales departments and operations experts work in finance.  Without a doubt, the core of this company is built around technical (R&D) and operations.  They do not understand nor care about marketing, strategy or sales.   While the company claims to be focused on 'growth', all internal indications and behaviors clearly demonstrate they are focused on their historical nature of being a 'dividend' company. 

The company as a whole is terrible at prioritizing: every project, tactic and strategy is a priority.  If you ask what is priority, the most common response will be 'all of them'.  This lack of decisions making is consistent up and down leadership levels throughout the company.  Very little, if any, decision making and prioritization is driven down in to the organization and employees are not empowered nor entrusted to make key decisions. 

Because of the historical pension program, the motivation is low among more tenured employees.  Many are due to retire in the near future, with those that are near retirement uninterested in new ideas, business strategies or breakthrough innovation.  The overall goal is to get to retirement without any significant change.  Those with longer tenures do not value outside experience.  Their is an unspoken understanding that those with outside experience are known for having 'A3' and 'B3' experience (i.e A.D. and B.C.). 
Only experience gained with 3M tends to be valued by other 3M'ers who have been with the company for most of their careers.  The overall culture focuses on  'checking the box' and 'falling in line with your boss'.   While titles appear to show a flat organization, make no mistake, decision making is very much hierarchical.    The company needs a complete cultural reset to have a strong chance of succeeding in the future.",,2019-04-17,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.8333333333333333,4.475978077303381,1.6922962337675127,3.944045775531449,3.602428456218384,2.3975715437816167,4.338398891057067,2.4326899438711393,3.5010023565933395,2.935219812277369,1.223469094472344,2.419355636859458,3.5215367824392283,3.8945959882079846,2.8271069423494066,4.969915719010583,1.00078324803228,4.994203747781227,overall pay well good benefit overall base pay strong match k varying percentage based level offer employee stock purchase program discount standard yearly pay increase,company clearly focused centered around bb understand consumer driven business adopt business model practice accordingly come consumer based company disappointed marketing budget consistently first area cut company spends approximately traditional cpg company spend marketing much adopt mindset build better mousetrap company freely move people role experience expertise appreciate willingness allow people move freely within company assign people role based tenure experience expertise people supply chain background run marketing customer service background run sale department operation expert work finance without doubt core company built around technical rd operation understand care marketing strategy sale company claim focused growth internal indication behavior clearly demonstrate focused historical nature dividend company company whole terrible prioritizing every project tactic strategy priority ask priority common response lack decision making consistent leadership level throughout company little decision making prioritization driven organization employee empowered entrusted make key decision historical pension program motivation low among tenured employee many due retire near future near retirement uninterested new idea business strategy breakthrough innovation overall goal get retirement without significant change longer tenure value outside experience unspoken understanding outside experience known b experience ie ad bc experience gained tends valued mers company career overall culture focus checking box falling line bos title appear show flat organization make mistake decision making much hierarchical company need complete cultural reset strong chance succeeding future,19,2

There is this pride that I would say most employees have working for them because it is such a good company and you get to work on some really cool products that are used every day all over the world. In my personal experience, I always knew my management team had my back and they were excellent coaches and mentors, which can be hard to come by. I was able to work autonomously and create projects I wanted to work on and It was easy to get the resources you needed whether it was in the plant, through sister plants, or though their intracompany website (which is the only company I’ve worked for that I would say had a useful one). In my plant, the systems rarely made intuitive sense, but they worked and we did quite well as far as OTIF and Customer Service levels were concerned, so you could only make things better and more efficient, which is a great position to be in. Lastly, my coworkers were just down to earth. While you always will have the negative folks in any workplace, most people I worked with knew what their goals were and just wanted to achieve them with as little mellow drama as possible and get paid (which 3M also does well).","3M is a baby boomer dressed in millennial's clothing. On the outside they seem really hip and trendy, but you soon learn the inner workings of the company are still that of a behemoth Fortune 500 company; change is hard to push and there is a lot of red tape to get some things approved.

My main complaint would be the lack of vacation days provided from the start. I've worked for a lot of different multinational corporations; the ones that are competitive for great employees give at least 3 weeks’ vacation to start with. But, I actually had to give up a week of my vacation time when I joined 3M as they would not negotiate this outdated norm that new employees should only have 2 weeks to start with. This was actually one of my main reasons for leaving the company, as I live across the country from where my family is and I did not get to see them as much as I had before because travel times were just too long to get back home within a 2-3 day weekend. I worked for 3M for over 2 years, and I would have had to wait another 2 just to get that 3rd week. I did get a month of sick days, but I was not allowed to use them for medical appointments, which in 2019 I happened to have a lot of.  So, I had to use my vacation time for these. The one time I got to go home in 2019 was for my grandmother's funeral, and I had to beg for 2 days of bereavement leave instead of the allowed 1 to compensate for the travel. 

I’m not looking for sympathy, I just find it perplexing that a company that says it is as socially responsible as they say they are has not kept up with the times on this policy. I left for a similar sized, well respected company that gave me 3 weeks right off the bat with an additional week of flex holidays. If it weren’t for this con, I would have loved to stay with 3M.",,2019-12-04,0,1,1,0,0,2,4.333333333333333,1.5566935102211594,1.6248247004591831,4.5081223415842056,2.578675029265317,3.421324970734683,2.3406115509297267,2.595247018441151,4.6127906411350015,1.5226212562202677,1.2391585929225086,3.1904129109396173,1.634272438811863,2.376609193726231,2.5118748375707725,1.0000262336571024,1.010354901513238,4.994652823773984,absolutely loved working pride would say employee working good company get work really cool product used every day world personal experience always knew management team back excellent coach mentor hard come wa able work autonomously create project wanted work wa easy get resource needed whether wa plant sister plant though intracompany website company ’ worked would say useful one plant system rarely made intuitive sense worked quite well far otif customer service level concerned could make thing better efficient great position lastly coworkers earth always negative folk workplace people worked knew goal wanted achieve little mellow drama possible get paid also doe well,baby boomer dressed millennials clothing outside seem really hip trendy soon learn inner working company still behemoth fortune company change hard push lot red tape get thing approved main complaint would lack vacation day provided start ive worked lot different multinational corporation one competitive great employee give least week ’ vacation start actually give week vacation time joined would negotiate outdated norm new employee week start wa actually one main reason leaving company live across country family get see much travel time long get back home within day weekend worked year would wait another get rd week get month sick day wa allowed use medical appointment happened lot use vacation time one time got go home wa grandmother funeral beg day bereavement leave instead allowed compensate travel ’ looking sympathy find perplexing company say socially responsible say ha kept time policy left similar sized well respected company gave week right bat additional week flex holiday ’ con would loved stay,5,0

The people I work with are also great.","Overall the benefits don't feel like they compete well with the other companies where I have peers.   They feel like they are the bare minimum to get people to come  to the company and stay.  

Starting with just 2 weeks of vacation and having to wait 4 years to get more just doesn't feel like enough in today's market where I have friends who start with 4 weeks or more. Most of the 2 weeks is quickly used to visit family over holidays if you don't live within driving distance so you spend the entire year getting burned out, or if you don't save vacation for around the holidays you are one of only a few who have to be working over the holidays, which in the team environment makes it difficult to get anything done. 

The rest of the benefits feel like they are just good enough to make you consider 3M or stay.  None lead the industry and it feels like 3M is just barley keeping up with competitors. 

I would love to see 3M make some changes to lead the industry and be more attractive to newer employees.  Something like giving employees one more week of vacation or closing sites the week of Christmas feels like a small sacrifice for the extra satisfaction and appeal the company would have for both new and old employees.

-Strong brand on your resume (for now)
-Potential exposure to multiple business models/markets/geographies
-Good place to work if you're in sales or a technical function","I can only speak for my experience in Supply Chain within certain businesses over several years. 3M only values technical skill sets, and sales to a lesser extent. Supply Chain at 3M is viewed as a transactional, non-professional support function, and is not viewed as part of the business in any division. Supply Chain Analysts in most divisions and plants spend 80% + of their time doing non-value added transactional activities to keep the business running due to 3M's horrifically antiquated IT systems. Seriously, it's like stepping into a time machine back to the 1970s. SAP implementation has gone horribly (to the surprise of no one). The Supply Chain Manager of most businesses reports to the Manufacturing Director; Supply Chain is not it's own vertical like it is at most peer companies that aren't stuck in the 1970s. Most Supply Chain leaders at 3M have no education and minimal experience in the function. Two out of the last three SVPs of Supply Chain had ZERO prior Supply Chain experience. One of them had an MBA from Harvard, so that made him qualified to run the Supply Chain function of a $30B+ organization with zero experience, I guess.

As far as the actual work environment goes, culture can vary by a lot by division but is mostly very old-school and non professional. There is no actual performance review process or development planning. If you work in Supply Chain (and don't have an engineering background) the best you can hope for in terms of career development is jumping from division to division and hope you can get promoted to Supervisor after 15+ years. I can say that in the last division I worked in verbal abuse/beratement by managers and people in other functions was a daily occurrence. Plenty of incompetent people in all functions counting down the days until they can collect their pension (and will not be replaced, 9 times out of 10). 3M is trying hard to make it look like this is a hip place to work. The reality is they have an extremely hard time keeping millennials who will leave for better compensation, time off, advancement potential, etc.

As others have mentioned, you start out with 10 vacation days and this does not increase to 15 until four years of service. They try to make it sound like it's better than it is because they give you 4 floating holidays, except these are Federal holidays that 3M doesn't recognize but you would get off at most other companies anyways.",,2020-01-26,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.5,4.019167522034742,2.1064899964040915,4.1650108137955835,3.671220708138175,2.3287792918618253,3.7238060782176388,3.0981289060349884,3.8488817705037137,3.89755650668846,1.905733381988515,2.7809647994028266,2.4435455415780867,4.166559423280853,2.888198099363473,4.0037725787571645,1.000476054528755,4.982470772945519,decent compensation benefit strong brand resume potential exposure multiple business modelsmarketsgeographies good place work youre sale technical function,speak experience supply chain within certain business several year value technical skill set sale lesser extent supply chain viewed transactional nonprofessional support function viewed part business division supply chain analyst division plant spend time nonvalue added transactional activity keep business running due horrifically antiquated system seriously like stepping time machine back sap implementation ha gone horribly surprise one supply chain manager business report manufacturing director supply chain vertical like peer company arent stuck supply chain leader education minimal experience function two last three svps supply chain zero prior supply chain experience one mba harvard made qualified run supply chain function b organization zero experience guess far actual work environment go culture vary lot division mostly oldschool non professional actual performance review process development planning work supply chain dont engineering background best hope term career development jumping division division hope get promoted supervisor year say last division worked verbal abuseberatement manager people function wa daily occurrence plenty incompetent people function counting day collect pension replaced time trying hard make look like hip place work reality extremely hard time keeping millennials leave better compensation time advancement potential etc others mentioned start vacation day doe increase four year service try make sound like better give floating holiday except federal holiday doesnt recognize would get company anyways,-1,2

There's not a lot of time or money spent in frivolities here, so if you want silly perks, huge admerch budgets and a lot of fun & games, this is definitely NOT the place for you. 
On the other hand, if you're not intimidated by science, you want to learn a lot, get your hands dirty and handle very complex products often harshly challenged by cheaper, crappier versions of them, this is the place for you.
People in general are very nice and you can make friends here however.
If you're smart and work hard, you will find a lot of opportunities to grow, but they seldom come to knock at your door. You have to network and sell yourself, which is very hard for some of us and very easy for those who often deserve less.
Overall, a great company, more diverse than most because it's Global, but with work to do in the diversity department still.","2 things:
- I wish 3M tried harder to detect and recognize work truly well done and good employees. In general (there are exceptions), if you're not as talented a self-promoter as you are an employee, don't play the squeaky wheel game wisely or have an Ivy League education, you might be eternally overlooked for promotions or sexier assignments (my boat is more rocked by increasing responsibilities than increasing pay, but that's me), no matter what your successes and accomplishments are. This can be especially true with women and minority employees. In the company there are still big pockets with a total old boys' club mentality
- I wish creativity and thinking outside the box was rewarded and encouraged beyond the R&D functions. Considering our budgets, it is very important to be creative in all functions, especially Marketing.

already logged,Forces political beliefs on workers,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,"August 29, 2020",Past,Operator,"Houston, TX",No,Neutral,Neutral,Full-time,I worked at 3M full-time,A job that pays money,"3M is your typical corporation, and for those who have seen the documentary, “The Corporation,” you'll know what I mean. In addition to that, the Springfield plant is no different than any other workplace, especially large factories - favoritism, discrimination, unfairness, backbiting, the good-ole-boy network, good workers are punished, slackers are rewarded, silly rules, rules that are just made up when convenient, wasted time and money, the blame game, and the common mismanagement pretty much sums it up. Compensation needs to be improved, about $5-$10hr more plus profit sharing, since the workers are dealing with deadly chemicals and therefore endangering themselves, their co-workers, and the community. Mandatory overtime can be a problem and you will be expected to work 19 12-hour days straight to meet “business needs.” But they will give you 2 days off only to repeat the 19 days if necessary, because they care about you and your family, so they say.

With that said, after nearly 4 years of service I was terminated for not conforming to the political beliefs of 3M that were being forced upon the workers. For the last 5 months of my employment I put up with the new policies, the signs, the emails, and verbal communications regarding so-called “COVID-19” and didn't dare question any of it, since questioning the Narrative is strictly forbidden. Despite the absurdities, the lies, the insults, the guilt-tripping, and all of us being treated like children, I remained quiet and said nothing. Even when some mystery dude came around spraying everything and everybody in the break room while we were trying to eat, I just fled the scene and allowed him to continue. As the mask ritual became the latest brainwashing campaign, 3M Springfield brought this charade into the plant and distributed masks for voluntary use, twice, which I simply ignored as did everyone else. At this point I became concerned because I knew the Plan was calling for mandatory participation, so my dignity line was drawn. Being forced to wear some dehumanizing mask that marks my acceptance of an immoral agenda and implies I am contaminated and that my co-workers are contaminated crosses that line, and I refuse to be disrespected and degraded by selfish, unloving people who simultaneously puff themselves up to be virtuous, be it 3M or anywhere else.

After the mandatory mask announcement I requested a personal leave of absence with 3M Springfield HR due to religious objections to wearing a mask for this purpose. After supposedly discussing with “the team” for over a week, the HR manager and whoever is on this team, as expected, did not approve the leave, did not offer an accommodation, and would not let me in the plant without a mask even though I was willing and able to work, so the official termination is blamed on absenteeism.

Most people are aware that this mask agenda has nothing to do with health and safety, no matter how much the order-followers lie and chant their mantra, but rather compliance, conditioning, symbolism, ritual, and superstition. If anyone desires to work with 3M, or any other large corporation, be prepared to be treated like a dumb animal because the mask is only the beginning, so it may be best to just avoid the trap and not even give these seared-conscience people the satisfaction of forcing their inhumane beliefs upon you.",,2020-08-29,0,0,0,1,0,1,1.1666666666666667,2.9725016953321624,2.699425022991271,4.075863020909346,3.4475989680650305,2.5524010319349704,4.772315718401528,3.7259973847796815,3.971101083351442,3.1865253747685647,3.577744728472729,2.6623976725166525,2.7860144653523324,3.4788548516101088,1.8107985209040205,1.2072974044717772,1.0291516617665963,4.992905410179226,job pay money,typical corporation seen documentary “ corporation ” youll know mean addition springfield plant different workplace especially large factory favoritism discrimination unfairness backbiting goodoleboy network good worker punished slacker rewarded silly rule rule made convenient wasted time money blame game common mismanagement pretty much sum compensation need improved hr plus profit sharing since worker dealing deadly chemical therefore endangering coworkers community mandatory overtime problem expected work hour day straight meet “ business need ” give day repeat day necessary care family say said nearly year service wa terminated conforming political belief forced upon worker last month employment put new policy sign email verbal communication regarding socalled “ covid ” didnt dare question since questioning narrative strictly forbidden despite absurdity lie insult guilttripping u treated like child remained quiet said nothing even mystery dude came around spraying everything everybody break room trying eat fled scene allowed continue mask ritual became latest brainwashing campaign springfield brought charade plant distributed mask voluntary use twice simply ignored everyone else point became concerned knew plan wa calling mandatory participation dignity line wa drawn forced wear dehumanizing mask mark acceptance immoral agenda implies contaminated coworkers contaminated cross line refuse disrespected degraded selfish unloving people simultaneously puff virtuous anywhere else mandatory mask announcement requested personal leave absence springfield hr due religious objection wearing mask purpose supposedly discussing “ team ” week hr manager whoever team expected approve leave offer accommodation would let plant without mask even though wa willing able work official termination blamed absenteeism people aware mask agenda ha nothing health safety matter much orderfollowers lie chant mantra rather compliance conditioning symbolism ritual superstition anyone desire work large corporation prepared treated like dumb animal mask beginning may best avoid trap even give searedconscience people satisfaction forcing inhumane belief upon,8,-1

Almost cult like the positivity people exhibit about being there. The company does a good job of making you proud of being a 3mer.,"Before I start, let’s start with a simple presumption, “Sales people want to make money. The harder they work, and more success they have, the more money they should make.” 

This is NOT the premise the entire Inside Sales Dept. follows. If you are looking for the premise above, look elsewhere.

If you are fine putting in a decent amount of hard work, keep your head down, have no drive to make 6 figures, and instead are cool with a annual 2% raise in your base salary to have a shot in 3 years of a 10-15% raise into a higher level ISR. Sign up for this “sales” job...which really is a glorified order taker or account manager. It is a high base salary 65-75k account manager role. This is not a professional ISR role in whatever dept you end up in. The commission plans are inept.

No one “makes plan” the commission plan changed 6 times in 12 months. Most of the time we were on guarantee as management had no clue what they were doing. 
If you want to receive commission, and excel into higher yearly gross...That is NOT the path 3M takes. The Inside Sales department is valued by the company at large and is receiving lots of investment, BUT it doesn’t translate into common sense. 
No one exceeds plan, no one. That means the plan is BS. It is simply a salaried position and is an embarrassment for a Fortune 100 to state otherwise. 

But that’s what you get when you have a national inside sales director with no sales experience. See, 3M promotes only from within so they have the same silly po-dunk, middle of the road, conservative ideas that the C-level scientist leaders above then think are sensible. Not one ISR makes above 100k with commissions. Several make 90k as a base salary, but that’s it...there’s no commission happening, maybe 5k annually...is that a sales role? You tell me.

Lastly- if you’re a woman or a minority-beware of the grade level they hire you in at...no matter how qualified you are for other roles in the company they have a strict HR rule that limits upward promotion. 

Dumbest thing I saw was a co-worker, who had more qualifications than most of the competition, was not allowed to sit for interviews with hiring managers that were interested in her, because as a minority she was initially hired in at such an entry level ranking, (way below what she was worth on the open market to save money) and therefore, even though she exceeded the qualifications on the job listing and the managers wanted to interview her, she was denied the change to interview because it beyond 2 steps from her ranking. Total BS for a company that prides itself on diversity. 
She would have had to leave the company and apply for the job (unlikely to get a call because they prioritize promoting  from within), or wait 10 yrs before she is able to interview for the dream position that she is qualified for now...talk about a bunch of middle aged HR/c level white guys golfing on the company course thinking up policies. “But don’t worry we’ll send gobs of promotional emails and team newsletters swearing that we prioritize and appreciate our female and minority colleagues...HAHAHA!”",,2020-11-02,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.7142857142857142,4.289659209802261,1.7262264359556545,4.526113292111013,3.7664932348120024,2.2335067651879985,4.153428558248375,2.9855220743829305,4.013528956881567,2.444611217442999,1.084022065803936,3.6856372953093466,3.4240214893571284,2.632360159071829,3.2630132349517886,4.9969168298270965,1.0001490651705771,4.997785385199823,decent culture company large almost cult like positivity people exhibit company doe good job making proud mer,start let ’ start simple presumption “ sale people want make money harder work success money make ” premise entire inside sale dept follows looking premise look elsewhere fine putting decent amount hard work keep head drive make figure instead cool annual raise base salary shot year raise higher level isr sign “ sale ” jobwhich really glorified order taker account manager high base salary k account manager role professional isr role whatever dept end commission plan inept one “ make plan ” commission plan changed time month time guarantee management clue want receive commission excel higher yearly grossthat path take inside sale department valued company large receiving lot investment ’ translate common sense one exceeds plan one mean plan b simply salaried position embarrassment fortune state otherwise ’ get national inside sale director sale experience see promotes within silly podunk middle road conservative idea clevel scientist leader think sensible one isr make k commission several make k base salary ’ itthere ’ commission happening maybe k annuallyis sale role tell lastly ’ woman minoritybeware grade level hire atno matter qualified role company strict hr rule limit upward promotion dumbest thing saw wa coworker qualification competition wa allowed sit interview hiring manager interested minority wa initially hired entry level ranking way wa worth open market save money therefore even though exceeded qualification job listing manager wanted interview wa denied change interview beyond step ranking total b company pride diversity would leave company apply job unlikely get call prioritize promoting within wait yr able interview dream position qualified nowtalk bunch middle aged hrc level white guy golfing company course thinking policy “ ’ worry ’ send gob promotional email team newsletter swearing prioritize appreciate female minority colleagueshahaha ”,5,2

Everyone seems to uphold the companies values and in my two years working there I have not met anyone I wouldn't want to work with again. It is a large company so there is some ""Bureaucracy"" but I have never found it to hinder my job. The thing I like most about 3M is their flexibility in working and their willingness to do what is best for the employees and company rather than just the shareholders like many other companies in todays world. They are very ""conservative"" in their approach so don't expect crazy high salaries and crazy new world perks(like unlimited PTO, drinking at work, constant parties) but I have found everything about my job and its benefits to be fair or better than average. The most surprising thing to me about 3M is how many employees have been there 20, 25, 30+ years and still love their job, I think that is a testament to how well 3M treats their people.",I really cant think of very many cons.

- HIS Division functions a bit like a start-up : laid back, able to control your own sprint items/research items, lots of freedom with AWS/tech stacks (although that can be from team to team)
- Decent Healthcare
- Time off is lackluster unless you get a boost because of where you live, then it's awesome
- Sick time is pretty stellar
- 401K Match is decent + StockOptions are a nice perk
- Most of the functional teams who lack the software/cloud knowledge are really trying to come up to speed; there are lot of good people working really hard to grow/be better in the software cloud space. (But, lots of managers who aren't want to put down others and get defensive).","- Still a pretty heavy white Boys club, especially in upper management. There are some female/non-white/non-binary faces, but not enough throughout the org, ESPECIALLY in engineering
- The Job function structure is opaque, I've interviewed people who were to be in a grade above me with less experience in my skill set
- A lot of the brilliant engineers I've worked with are actually Contractors/employees of Stelligent, so they don't stick around
- 3M HIS seems to have trouble hiring/finding talent for some reason--HR I think doesn't know how to recruit Software Engineering folks, so a lot of Managers and team leads are doing double duty finding people. Hiring process is SUppppppper slow/drawn out/unorganized so we lose candidates before we can even interview them
- Definite disconnect between the actual engineers and management who controls our destiny (I get the sense that no one read my resume/I've gotten silo-ed/forgotten)
- Corporate policies are still not quite there with functioning like a software company
- There's no on-call : the reason this is a negative is because they haven't designed it yet. The teams are really advanced/accelerated in some aspects and in the dark ages in others. (Advance CICD/IaC, yet no ops support, and the cloud security team is completely lost).I can see this coming back to bite 3M when the SLAs/apps get more attention by users. Some managers are trying to fix this. . . 
- whenever corporate networking has to get involved, it's a power struggle. They don't understand cloud and generally behave like the 1990s with IP space requests; there's a definite sense of some teams feeling threatened outside our little engineering/devops bubble
- education reimbursement is pint-sized compared to company size",,2021-01-22,1,1,1,0,0,3,3.1428571428571432,1.9825757999827809,3.5527478868260864,4.164824412279363,3.425816860680837,2.574183139319163,1.6078056343307776,3.036368348726291,3.8987311776906632,4.072635889244811,1.4930451652308794,2.758404076674025,1.4759515730659645,3.0774001473071158,2.696621502181633,1.000424269781683,4.802831618129853,4.998897700882359,amazing intelligent engineer ive ever pleasure working team sister team division function bit like startup laid back able control sprint itemsresearch item lot freedom awstech stack although team team decent healthcare time lackluster unless get boost live awesome sick time pretty stellar k match decent stockoptions nice perk functional team lack softwarecloud knowledge really trying come speed lot good people working really hard growbe better software cloud space lot manager arent want put others get defensive,still pretty heavy white boy club especially upper management femalenonwhitenonbinary face enough throughout org especially engineering job function structure opaque ive interviewed people grade le experience skill set lot brilliant engineer ive worked actually contractorsemployees stelligent dont stick around seems trouble hiringfinding talent reasonhr think doesnt know recruit software engineering folk lot manager team lead double duty finding people hiring process suppppppper slowdrawn outunorganized lose candidate even interview definite disconnect actual engineer management control destiny get sense one read resumeive gotten siloedforgotten corporate policy still quite functioning like software company oncall reason negative havent designed yet team really advancedaccelerated aspect dark age others advance cicdiac yet ops support cloud security team completely losti see coming back bite slasapps get attention user manager trying fix whenever corporate networking ha get involved power struggle dont understand cloud generally behave like ip space request definite sense team feeling threatened outside little engineeringdevops bubble education reimbursement pintsized compared company size,5,2

As a scientist, working at 3M is like being a kid living in a toy store. It's a wonderful feeling being a part of world-class innovation. I absolutely love the work I do, and it's a real thrill to develop exciting products alongside other passionate scientists and engineers.","Unfortunately, 3M seems to have some major faults, especially in today's sociopolitical climate. It's hard to write this, but it's important to share.

From my point of view as a scientist and product developer, 3M seems to care more about its shareholders and its managers than it does about the people inventing and manufacturing the products that make our company relevant. This is a sad situation and I think 3M can do better. The first step is acknowledging some of its many serious missteps:

3M cut jobs and salaries during the pandemic, but somehow had plenty of cash to pay out as dividends to rich investors on Wall Street. This makes very little sense from an organizational health perspective. And it makes even less sense from a social justice perspective where income inequality is such a strong forced for much of the negativity we see in the US right now. Furthermore, 3M promotes and rewards managers who lay off productive and valuable workers with no regard for the pandemic-rattled job market. Leadership would do better by 3M to adopt a Stakeholder Mindset.

3M claims to be an inclusive company committed to sustainability and equality, but continues to reward career sharks who stifle truly sustainable innovation and the diverse people who drive that innovation. 3M cancels programs and stifles innovations that offer true sustainability (even ones with objectively excellent profitability) in favor of gratuitously high and unsustainable profit margins. 3M further rewards the same lock-step managers who feed this toxic culture, and stifles the careers of those who try to make a positive impact to our global society. As a scientist and global citizen, it is incredibly hard to see this happening at such an ostensibly progressive company like 3M.

While 3M is truly excellent at charitable donations around the world, there are serious internal problems with diversity and inclusion. I applaud 3M's philanthropy, and hope to see improvements in culture internally. For example, while we do have quite a few underrepresented groups in leadership roles, many of these people have the same career shark mentality that prevents the people they're representing in their demographic from thriving and attaining similar success.

Now, this message board ensures that ""each employer has the right to respond to a review left by a member for free, and that the employer be given the last word on a review."" I enthusiastically invite a response to this thoughtful review - with the counterargument that our planet, 3M's employees and customers, and humanity's global society always have the last word. 

3M needs to do better. 

The good news is that we can do better. We have many excellent people. We just need to have the right people in leadership roles.

Vacation time when you start.,"There is zero work/life balance. They do not care if you have a family, scheduled appointments or obligations outside of work. They expect you to cancel if you are forced in on OT and to always put the company first, even above your family. One of several examples: if your child is sick and you need to call in, you have to say that YOU are sick. You can't say that your child is sick or you won't be allowed the time off. 

The converting department is one of the most toxic in the building which is why they struggle to keep the dept. staffed. The gossip makes the environment hard to work in. In addition to associates, some of the group leads gossip openly and within ear shot about associates they don't care for despite the company posters everywhere about gossip and acting professional. 

Associates are incredibly hard on (almost to the point of bullying) - those hired off the street that didn't have to go through the temp agency (Volt) and management does nothing to address this ongoing issue. With that said, associates that have been there longer will be heard over you, even if they're dishonest. You ca do and act any way you wish if you've been there a long time and not be held accountable. You have no voice with anyone until you've been there a few years. 

Management doesn't like to address issues. There's more of an interest in making the problem go away than there is in fixing it. Only come to them with department ideas and never come to them with problems that need addressing. If you're ever accused of something there, just take your lickings and move on, even if you didn't do it. They like smooth sailings and will see you as a problem if you disrupt that for them.",,2021-03-28,1,0,0,1,0,2,2.0,4.398092019573377,2.031183996168962,3.8464077140024537,3.673128101746386,2.3268718982536134,3.965150687653655,2.576442436162555,3.6538475568641315,3.4859301670077096,2.012845087774068,1.952195119722989,2.144267797454715,3.847621523716508,2.7132229361663303,4.9948610650614365,1.2070872975724796,4.992459196062153,triple pay holiday vacation time start,zero worklife balance care family scheduled appointment obligation outside work expect cancel forced ot always put company first even family one several example child sick need call say sick cant say child sick wont allowed time converting department one toxic building struggle keep dept staffed gossip make environment hard work addition associate group lead gossip openly within ear shot associate dont care despite company poster everywhere gossip acting professional associate incredibly hard almost point bullying hired street didnt go temp agency volt management doe nothing address ongoing issue said associate longer heard even theyre dishonest ca act way wish youve long time held accountable voice anyone youve year management doesnt like address issue interest making problem go away fixing come department idea never come problem need addressing youre ever accused something take licking move even didnt like smooth sailing see problem disrupt,3,0
