Despite the substantial environmental harms they cause-habitat loss and degradation, soil erosion and sedimentation, water resources depletion, soil and water salinization, agrochemical releases, animal wastes, nonpoint source water pollution, and air pollution-environmental law has given them a virtual license to do so. When combined, the active and passive safe harbors farms enjoy in most environmental laws amount to an anti-law that finds no rational basis given the magnitude of harms farms cause. This paper comprehensively documents the environmental harms farms cause and the safe harbors they enjoy in environmental law, then argues for a core federal statute that blends regulation, information, tax, incentive, and trading instruments to address several of the major sources of harm. It is shown that conventional prescriptive regulation simply will not effectively fit the geographic, economic, and political demographics of farms, but that the proposed blend of instruments could achieve significant gains in farms' environmental performance without excessive administrative or compliance complexities and costs.

By contrast, some issues are gender-neutral, such as economic or business issues that are of no special concern to any gender-based constituency.  The 2002 bankruptcy bill, advanced by the consumer credit industry as its highest legislative priority, features a number of provisions that would fall especially hard  on households headed by women and on women with children.  Far more women will be affected by changes in the bankruptcy bill than almost any other legislation pending in Washington in the past several years, yet the bill has not become a rallying point for those committed to equal justice and fairness for women.

	",210.0,"This article considers the constitutional case for the impeachability of federal officers after they have left office. As a practical matter, while it may rarely be worthwhile to pursue a late impeachment (as with regular impeachment), this does not change the fact that it can be done, or that certain facts may make it desirable. The article principally argues that: (1) Late impeachment was practiced in England and, unlike other aspects of English impeachment, was never explicitly ruled out in America. Indeed, some state constitutions made late impeachability explicit, or even required. (2) Structurally, impeachment is designed not just to remove but to deter, and this effect would be severely undermined if it faded away near the end of a term. Convicted impeachees can be disqualified from future federal office, an important punishment that should not be automatically mooted if the officer resigns or the president removes him. (3) The precedents are mixed, but the Senate has approved late impeachment. Senate opponents of late impeachment have not prevented late trials, and they cannot alter the formal declaration of a majority of the Senate in one case that officers can indeed be impeached after they have left office.

This essay provides historical context for Giles v. Harris (1903) and traces the doctrinal implications for 20th Century constitutional law of Holmes' conclusion that federal courts would not hear claims involving ""political rights."" Giles is virtually ignored in the principal sources of the constitutional canon, including the leading Constitutional Law casebooks. The essay argues that this reflects the larger absence from the conventional constitutional canon of the subject of democracy itself as a systematic focus of study in its own right. By recovering the political, social, and Supreme Court history of the destruction through law of democracy in the early part of the 20th century, this essay contributes to a larger project of seeking to place democracy itself at the center of constitutional thought.

	",,"While the market for auto lending at first appears to be highly competitive, many consumers lack the ability to obtain accurate information about price. In many markets, uninformed consumers can free ride off the knowledge of informed consumers. However, the market for auto lending differs from traditional markets because price ultimately depends upon both the credit worthiness of the individual borrower and the details of the auto loan (e.g. term length, payment-to-income ratio, etc.). Auto dealers in this market act as agents of both consumers (identifying suitable auto lenders for them) and auto lenders (identifying prospective borrowers). Given the asymmetric information about prices facing consumers, this market has been characterized by a wide disparity in the prices paid by consumers. This disparity comes about through a mechanism whereby auto dealers are quoted a risk-based interest rate from the lender and are then authorized to subjectively mark up this rate and charge what the market will bear. While the majority of auto loans are written without any markup, some consumers are charged thousands of dollars in addition to the risk-based interest rate. While charging different prices to different consumers is not illegal, one of the apparent consequences in auto lending is that minority consumers - African-Americans and Hispanics in particular - have systematically been charged a higher markup on auto loans than White borrowers. It is this fact - coupled with federal laws outlawing discrimination in credit markets - that led to a series of lawsuits against auto lending institutions. This paper reviews the theory and evidence of subjective markups on auto loans and examines how class action litigation has changed the auto lending market.

Although the average tenure of a Supreme Court Justice from 1789 through 1970 was 14.9 years, for those Justices who have retired since 1970, the average tenure has jumped to 26.1 years. Because of the long tenure of recent members of the Court, there were no vacancies on the high Court from 1994 to the middle of 2005. We believe the American constitutional rule granting life tenure to Supreme Court Justices is fundamentally flawed, resulting now in Justices remaining on the Court for longer periods and to a later age than ever before in American history.     
This trend has led to significantly less frequent vacancies on the Court, which reduces the efficacy of the democratic check that the appointment process provides on the Court's membership. The increase in the longevity of Justices' tenure means that life tenure now guarantees a much longer tenure on the Court than was the case in 1789 or over most of our constitutional history. Moreover, the combination of less frequent vacancies and longer tenures of office means that when vacancies do arise, there is so much at stake that confirmation battles have become much more intense. Finally, as was detailed in a recent article by Professor David Garrow, the advanced age of some Supreme Court Justices has at times led to a problem of ""mental decrepitude"" on the Court, whereby some Justices have become physically or mentally unable to fulfill their duties during the final stages of their careers.     
In this Article, we call for a change to the life tenure rule for Supreme Court Justices. To resolve the problems of life tenure, we propose that lawmakers pass a constitutional amendment pursuant to Article V of the Constitution instituting a system of staggered, eighteen-year term limits for Supreme Court Justices. The Court's membership would be constitutionally fixed at nine Justices, whose terms would be staggered such that a vacancy would occur on the Court every two years at the end of the term in every odd-numbered calendar year. Every one-term President would thus get to appoint two Justices and every two-term President would get to appoint four. Our proposal would not apply to any of the nine sitting Justices or to any nominee of the President in office when the constitutional amendment is ratified. Moving to a system of eighteen-year terms for Supreme Court Justices would restore the norms in this country that prevailed on the Court between 1789 and 1970, when vacancies occurred about once every two years, and Justices served an average of 14.9 years on the Court. We recommend that the country recommit itself to the tenure practices that held for Supreme Court Justices for most of our history.

In total, our results suggest that at least 1,200 additional driving deaths are attributable to the effect of 9/11. We also provide evidence that is consistent with the 9/11 effect on road fatalities weakening over time as drivers return to flying.

	",,"Learning theorists have demonstrated that people vary in the manner in which they absorb, process, and recall what they are taught. Verbal learners, a group that constitutes about 30% of the general population, learn by hearing. They benefit from class lectures and from discussion of class materials in study groups or in oral presentations, but chafe at written assignments. Experiential learners - about 5% of the population - learn by doing and touching, and clinical work, role-playing exercises, and moot court are their best instructional modalities. Visual learners - the remaining 65% of the population - need to see what they are learning, and while they have difficulty following oral lectures they perform well at written assignments and readily recall material they have read. The implications of variance in learning styles are particularly significant for legal educators. Empirical research supports the conclusions that when students are matched with teaching methods that complement their learning styles their absorption and retention is significantly enhanced. However, law professors who rely upon the Socratic method or more traditional lecturing techniques, as do the majority of those who teach doctrinal courses, particularly in the first-year curriculum, may be satisfying the pedagogical needs of their verbal learners without adequately engaging their kinesthetic or visual students, who comprise a majority of their classes. Students for whom traditional teaching methods are unsatisfactory may not only learn less but may suffer motivational problems and enjoy the law school experience less than their peers.    
Moreover, variations in learning styles have been linked to gender: women tend to be more visually oriented than men, who are generally more kinesthetic, and consequently female students are systematically more prone to suffer the deleterious effects of learning style-teaching method mismatch than men. However, sixteen years after the American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession suggested to law schools that the first-year curriculum would be improved by the use of greater variety of teaching methods in light of the diversity of learning styles in the student body, the typical first-year doctrinal course remains a predominantly verbal domain. In some degree this is a function of the subject matter. After all, law is a bibliocentric profession, and words are the coin of the realm. But we need not seek the radical transformation of the law to teach to the entire class. This Article presents empirical evidence demonstrating that the use of original art can assist legal educators to this end.

	",42.0,"We investigate which provisions, among a set of twenty-four governance provisions followed by the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC), are correlated with firm value and stockholder returns. Based on this analysis, we put forward an entrenchment index based on six provisions - four constitutional provisions that prevent a majority of shareholders from having their way (staggered boards, limits to shareholder bylaw amendments, supermajority requirements for mergers, and supermajority requirements for charter amendments), and two takeover readiness provisions that boards put in place to be ready for a hostile takeover (poison pills and golden parachutes). We find that increases in the level of this index are monotonically associated with economically significant reductions in firm valuation, as measured by Tobin's Q. We present suggestive evidence that the entrenching provisions cause lower firm valuation. We also find that firms with higher levels of the entrenchment index were associated with large negative abnormal returns during the 1990-2003 period. Moreover, examining all sub-periods of two or more years within this period, we find that a strategy of buying low entrenchment firms and selling short high entrenchment firms out-performs the market in most such periods and does not under-perform the market even in a single sub-period. Finally, we find that the provisions in our entrenchment index fully drive the correlation, identified by prior work, that the IRRC provisions in the aggregate have with reduced firm value and lower stock returns during the 1990s; we do not find any evidence that the other eighteen IRRC provisions are negatively correlated with either firm value or stock returns during the 1990-2003 period.

	",24.0,"There are several methods for ranking the scholarly performance of law faculties, including reputation surveys (U.S. News, Leiter); publication counts (Lindgren and Seltzer, Leiter); and citation counts (Eisenberg and Wells, Leiter). Each offers a useful but partial picture of faculty performance. We explore here whether the new ""beta"" SSRN-based measures (number of downloads and number of posted papers) can offer a different, also useful, albeit also partial, picture. Our modest claim is that SSRN-based measures can address some of the deficiencies in these other measures and thus play a valuable role in the rankings tapestry. For example, SSRN offers real-time data covering most American law schools and many foreign law schools, while citation and publication counts appear sporadically and cover a limited number of U.S. schools. The SSRN measures favor work with audiences across disciplines and across countries, while other measures are more law-centric and U.S.-centric. SSRN is relatively new and thus favors younger scholars and improving schools, while other measures favor more established scholars and schools. At the same time, the SSRN measures have important field and other biases, as well as gaming risks. We assess the correlations among the different measures, both on an aggregate and on a per-faculty-member basis. We find that all measures are strongly correlated; that total and per faculty measures are highly correlated; and that SSRN measures based on number of papers are highly correlated with measures based on number of downloads. Among major schools, all measures also correlate with school size.

"" The law was passed during the Theodore Roosevelt administration, and Roosevelt quickly set about designating a wide range of lands and resources as national monuments, including notably, the 800,000 acre Grand Canyon National Monument. Roosevelt's expansive interpretation of the law was embraced by later presidents and ultimately by the Supreme Court. In the latter part of the 20th century the use the law waxed and waned, reaching new heights with President Carter's spectacular designation of 56 million acres of land in Alaska as National Monuments, then falling dormant, only to become resurgent again at the end of President Clinton's first term with the designation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, and the designation of 21 new or expanded monuments in Clinton's second term.

It describes the many special places that have received protection under the law, and the many controversies that the law has sparked. It also addresses the myriad legal and policy issues raised by the law and its evolution as a conservation management tool.

Part I of the Article discusses Enron Corp.'s business operations in the years before its bankruptcy.  During this period, Enron was engaged in a costly and ultimately disastrous diversification strategy, starting a series of business initiatives in water, telecommunications, energy and other sectors of the economy that cost the company billions but failed to produce significant revenue.  To meet its rapidly escalating costs, Enron had to raise billions of dollars in capital markets but it needed to do so quietly, so as not to alarm banks and investors.  Faced with this quandary, the company resorted to deception.    
Part II explains how Enron's deception worked.  Enron wanted to appear profitable, raise billions of dollars in cash, and keep its reported debt low.  To accomplish this legerdemain, Enron employed a series of schemes to manipulate its financial statements.  These techniques helped Enron dramatically inflate its reported revenue and hide billions of dollars in debt.  They also misled investors and violated both federal criminal laws and relevant accounting rules.      
In Part III, I discuss what may be the most alarming aspect of the Enron case - the failure of Arthur Andersen, the Enron Board of Directors, Wall Street equity analysts, and the SEC to catch and disclose Enron's deception before it was too late, despite some critical warning signs.  I analyze the performance of each of these institutions in the Enron debacle and try to assess what went wrong.  I argue that the existence of systematic conflicts of interest, lack of incentives for diligent work performance, and the absence of meaningful checks on or reviews of institutional performance made protection of investors a low priority for the Enron board, auditors and stock analysts.  In the case of the SEC, I suggest that its performance was derailed by poor management and a misplaced sense of priorities.         
Since Enron, we have seen a period of intense reform.  In Part IV, I briefly discuss and assess some of these efforts to improve securities laws and regulatory practices, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, amendments to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, rule changes by the SEC and FASB, and reforms that resulted from litigation brought by New York's Attorney General, Elliot Spitzer.  I argue that many of these changes are useful, but that others are actually counter-productive.  I also address the most critical practical issue: where do we go from here?  The most basic question we need to ask is whether the reforms implemented since 2002 are adequate - whether they sufficiently address and correct the problems with our system of securities regulation evident in the Enron debacle and similar cases.  I argue that Sarbanes-Oxley and related reforms, though very useful in many respects, fail to mitigate sufficiently some of the major problems in the securities market, leaving investors extremely vulnerable to fraud and deception.      
Finally, in Part V, I discuss my three reform proposals to improve securities market oversight, protect investors, and prevent more Enrons in the future: criminalization of conduct by executives who negligently release material false information to the securities market, radical reform of the SEC, and mandatory auditor rotation.  These measures will improve the accuracy of information provided to investors and ensure that our equity markets continue to function in a safe, reliable, and efficient manner.

	",24.0,"This paper examines both empirically and theoretically the growth of U.S. executive pay during the period 1993-2003. During this period, pay has grown much beyond the increase that could be explained by changes in firm size, performance and industry classification. Had the relationship of compensation to size, performance and industry classification remained the same in 2003 as it was in 1993, mean compensation in 2003 would have been only about half of its actual size. During the 1993-2003 period, equity-based compensation has increased considerably in both new economy and old economy firms, but this growth has not been accompanied by a substitution effect, i.e., a reduction in non-equity compensation. The aggregate compensation paid by public companies to their top-five executives during the considered period added up to about $350 billion, and the ratio of this aggregate top-five compensation to the aggregate earnings of these firms increased from 5% in 1993-1995 to about 10% in 2001-2003. After presenting evidence about the growth of pay, we discuss alternative explanations for it. We examine how this growth could be explained under either the arm's length bargaining model of executive compensation or the managerial power model. Among other things, we discuss the relevance of the parallel rise in market capitalizations and in the use of equity-based compensation.

Despite this, we still know relatively little about the nature of lottery regressivity.  I use a new dataset on Powerball lotto sales to analyze how regressivity varies with jackpot size within a single lotto game. I find that these large-stakes games are significantly less regressive at higher jackpot sizes.  An out-of-sample extrapolation of these results suggest that the lottery becomes progressive at a jackpot around $806 million. This suggests that concerns about regressivity might be allayed by concentrating lotto games to produce higher average jackpots.

	",6.0,"A growing body of empirical evidence from psychology, sociology, law, and criminal justice has demonstrated that lay intuitions about punishment are strongly rooted in retributivism: i.e., the idea that punishment should be distributed in proportion to moral desert.  Level of harm is often thought to be indicative of desert, but harm described by victims (or survivors) in the context of victim impact evidence is subjective and often unforeseeable insofar as it is attributable to chance factors. How do observers (such as jurors or judges) use information about consequences determined by chance factors when they judge punishment?  The emotional and cognitive processes involved in jurors' use of victim impact evidence potentially reveals key insights about the psychological mechanisms underlying laypersons' punishment judgments generally.  This paper explores empirical evidence for the notion that the subjective harm experienced by the victim of an offense serves as proxy for the level of defendant's effort and culpability, and by implication, the perceived seriousness of the crime.

	",10.0,"The best interests of the child standard - the standard rule applied in custody disputes between two parents - leaves family court judges ample room to consider a parent's ideology. Parents have had their rights limited or denied partly based on their advocacy of racism, homosexuality, adultery, nonmarital sex, Communism, Nazism, pacifism and disrespect for the flag, fundamentalism, polygamy, or religions that make it hard for children to fit in the western way of life in this society.    
Courts have also penalized or enjoined speech that expressly or implicitly criticizes the other parent, even when the speech has a broader ideological dimension. One parent, for instance, was ordered to make sure that there is nothing in the religious upbringing or teaching that the minor child is exposed to that can be considered homophobic, because the other parent was homosexual. Others have lost rights based partly on telling their children that the other parent was damned to Hell. One mother was stripped of custody partly because she accurately told her 12-year-old daughter that her ex-husband, who had raised the daughter from birth, wasn't in fact the girl's biological father.    
Courts have also restricted a parent's religious speech when such speech was seen as inconsistent with the religious education that the custodial parent was providing. The cases generally rest on the theory (sometimes pure speculation, sometimes based on some evidence in the record) that the children will become confused and unhappy by the contradictory teachings, and be less likely to take their parents' authority seriously.    
This article argues these restrictions are generally unconstitutional, except when they're narrowly focused on preventing one parent from undermining the child's relationship with the other. But the observations that lead to this rule are likely, I think, to prove more interesting to readers than the rule itself: (1) The best interests test lets courts engage in viewpoint-based speech restriction. (2) The First Amendment is implicated not only when courts issue orders restricting parents' speech, but also when courts make custody or visitation decisions based on such speech. (3) Even when the cases involve religious speech, the Free Speech Clause is probably more important than the Religion Clauses. (4) If parents in intact families have First Amendment rights to speak to their children, without the government restricting the speech under a best interests standard, then parents in broken families generally deserve the same rights. (5) Parents in intact families should indeed be free to speak to their children - but not primarily because of their self-expression rights, or their children's interests in hearing the parents' views. Rather, the main reason to protect parental speech rights is that today's child listeners will grow up into the next generation's adult speakers.

	",100.0,"In a striking empirical regularity, deliberation tends to move groups, and the individuals who compose them, toward a more extreme point in the direction indicated by their own predeliberation judgments. For example, people who are opposed to the minimum wage are likely, after talking to each other, to be still more opposed; people who tend to support gun control are likely, after discussion, to support gun control with considerable enthusiasm; people who believe that global warming is a serious problem are likely, after discussion, to insist on severe measures to prevent global warming.  This general phenomenon -- group polarization -- has many implications for economic, political, and legal institutions. It helps to explain extremism, ""radicalization,"" cultural shifts, and the behavior of political parties and religious organizations; it is closely connected to current concerns about the consequences of the Internet; it also helps account for feuds, ethnic antagonism, and tribalism. Group polarization bears on the conduct of government institutions, including juries, legislatures, courts, and regulatory commissions. There are interesting relationships between group polarization and social cascades, both informational and reputational.

	",10.0,"Since March 8, 1920, the day the decision was announced, Eisner v. Macomber has profoundly influenced the development of the income tax system. The key to its continuing importance lies in its constitutionally framed explication of realization, one of the most stable, and powerful, elements of an almost constantly changing income tax. By the time the Court (apparently) downgraded the realization requirement to mere administrative convenience, the case had already left its indelible mark on key elements of the income tax. Not only did it ensure that realization was deeply embedded in the system, but it also influenced several other important areas of taxation.  
The chapter first analyzes the immediate reactions to the Macomber case, including the political furor it caused about judicial review. It next explains how the decision, including the political and constitutional concerns it raised, helped shape tax law in the areas of corporate taxation, capital gains, and exchanges of property in the years that followed.

Macomber and its reverberations continue to affect the tax code not just in the major areas previously mentioned but also by offering support for consumption tax provisions within the income tax.

	",37.0,"These are the opening remarks I delivered at the Symposium on Bloggership: How Blogs Are Transforming Legal Scholarship at Harvard Law School on April 28, 2006.  Part One describes how my work on TaxProf Blog and the Law Professor Blog Network led me to organize this Symposium.  Part Two takes inspiration from Jim Lindgren's work, Are Scholars Better Teachers?, to ask, using our twenty-three panelists as guinea pigs, Are Scholars Better Bloggers?  The data indicate that our participants include some of the most heavily-cited and heavily-downloaded legal scholars who edit many of the most heavily-trafficked law blogs.  Although the data do not do not conclusively answer the question raised, they demonstrate that we have assembled an impressive array of scholar-bloggers in the first conference on the impact of blogs on legal scholarship.  
The papers and commentary are organized around four themes: (1) Law Blogs as Legal Scholarship (papers by Doug Berman, Orin Kerr, Kate Litvak, and Larry Solum; commentary by Jim Lindgren and Ellen Podgor); (2) The Role of the Law Professor Blogger (papers by Gail Heriot, Gordon Smith, and Eugene Volokh; commentary by Randy Barnett and Michael Froomkin); (3) Blogs, First Amendment Law, and Co-Blogging Law (papers by Glenn Reynolds and Eric Goldman; commentary by Dan Solove and Betsy Malloy); and (4) The Many Faces of Law Professor Blogs (papers by Ann Althouse, Christine Hurt & Tung Yin, and Larry Ribstein; commentary by Howard Bashman and Paul Butler).  Paul Butler perhaps best captured the spirit of the Symposium with this clarion call:  Blogs are walking up to legal scholarship and slapping it in the face.  Blogs say to legal scholarship: 'How dare you!  Evolve or Die!' ... I feel like I am part of a movement that could change the world.

This paper examines the relation between morning sunshine at a country's leading stock exchange and market index stock returns that day at 26 stock exchanges internationally from 1982-97. Sunshine is strongly positively correlated with daily stock returns. After controlling for sunshine, other weather conditions such as rain and snow are unrelated to returns. If transactions costs are assumed to be minor, it is possible to trade profitably on the weather. These results are difficult to reconcile with fully rational price-setting.

Our analysis shows that fire is positively correlated with the price of beef and soy, and that the creation of new conservation units may offset the negative environmental impacts caused by the increasing number of fire events associated with early stages of frontier development.

	",6.0,"The Presidential election of 2000 raised a number of unprecedented legal and political issues. Among those were issues raised by the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, which provides for office space and funding to be made available to the President-elect to effectuate his transition to power. The statute vests in the Administrator of the General Services Administration the power to determine the President-elect under the statute and thereby to release the transition offices and funds. Following the certification of Florida's electoral votes in November 2000, George W. Bush could claim a majority of certified and pledged electoral votes and thus requested the release of the transition resources. The Administrator refused this request and refused to release the transition resources until after the Supreme Court's ruling in Bush v. Gore and Al Gore's subsequent concession. This essay examines the language, legislative history, political history, and policies of the Act and concludes that the Administrator acted improperly in refusing to recognize Bush as the President-elect following the certification of Florida's electoral votes for him. The essay examines the arguments advanced by the Administrator and concludes that they do not justify the vast power and discretion claimed by him under the Act. The essay then briefly considers possible amendments to the statute to prevent similar problems in the future. Most of the legal issues raised by the 2000 election are likely to be unique to that election and are unlikely to arise again in future elections. By contrast, the issues raised by the Presidential Transition Act are likely to occur again in the future, making necessary an understanding of the inaccuracies of the Administrator's acts in the 2000 election as well as the proper interpretation of the Act.

If those states which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravated assaults would have been avoided yearly. On the other hand, consistent with the notion of criminals responding to incentives, we find criminals substituting into property crimes involving stealth and where the probabilities of contact between the criminal and the victim are minimal. The largest population counties where the deterrence effect on violent crimes is greatest are where the substitution effect into property crimes is highest. Concealed handguns also have their greatest deterrent effect in the highest crime counties. Higher arrest and conviction rates consistently and dramatically reduce the crime rate. Consistent with other recent work, the results imply that increasing the arrest rate, independent of the probability of eventual conviction, imposes a significant penalty on criminals. The estimated annual gain from allowing concealed handguns is at least $6.214 billion.

	",128.0,"The exclusive right of public performance of a musical composition now brings to composers and songwriters revenue of approximately one billion dollars a year in the US alone.  However, this right was not firmly established until a century after America's first copyright statute, relying until then on the common-law principles that protected unpublished works.  The first effort to create this right by statute was the Ingersoll Copyright Bill, an omnibus revision in 1844 which died quickly in committee.  After that 50 years passed, and in the final quarter of the nineteenth century the need for statutory protection for public performance became more and more obvious as a result of litigation, especially that surrounding the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta The Mikado.  In the mid-1890s the right was once again proposed in an omnibus revision that died in committee, the Treloar Copyright Bill.

	",,"An untested assumption of Chapter 7 bankruptcy is that it rehabilitates debtors for a fresh start in the economy. Using original, longitudinal data, we examine this assumption against the realities of life after bankruptcy.  Our findings challenge the fresh start as the theoretical underpinning for consumer bankruptcy relief. We found that just one year after bankruptcy, one in four debtors was struggling to pay routine bills, and one in three debtors reported an overall financial situation similar to, or worse than, when they filed bankruptcy. Our analysis of these data demonstrates that steady and sufficient income is the key to improved post-bankruptcy financial health. Factors that cause household income to decline, such as unemployment and underemployment, illness or injury, and old age, undermine the chances of financial recovery. These data reveal the limitations of bankruptcy as a social safety net and highlight the fragile economic situations of American families. We conclude that bankruptcy is an incomplete tool to rehabilitate those in financial distress, and we suggest adjustments to bankruptcy law and social programs that will improve the ability of consumers to achieve a fresh start after financial failure.

	",,"In this study, Professor Lindgren examined data on the 108 confirmed nominees to the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal from the administrations of George H.W. Bush and William J. Clinton.  He shows - for the first time - evidence of differential treatment of nominees by the American Bar Association's rating committee.  Yet this is not a simple story of apparent ABA bias toward Clinton nominees. Among confirmed nominees with the most important credential - prior judicial experience - Bush nominees fare roughly as well and sometimes even better than Clinton nominees.     The problem arises for those without judicial experience. Here the apparent preference for Clinton appointees is strikingly large. Without controlling for any credentials, Clinton confirmed nominees have 9.1 times as high odds of getting a unanimous well qualified rating as do Bush confirmed nominees. Controlling for credentials, Clinton nominees have 9.7-15.9 times as high odds of getting a unanimous well qualified ABA rating as similarly credentialed Bush appointees. For those without prior judicial experience, just being nominated by Clinton instead of Bush is a stronger positive variable than any other credential or than all other credentials put together.   The differences in how the ABA treats Bush and Clinton nominees reaches even to the committee's internal decision making.  The ABA committee split its vote 33% of the time while evaluating Bush appointees, but only 17% of the time when evaluating Clinton appointees. This difference was concentrated among those who lacked prior judicial experience, where 50% of Bush appointees had split ratings, compared to only 10% of Clinton appointees with split ratings.

	",18.0,"Despite their role at the forefront of empirical research on the legal system, bankruptcy scholars are typical of the legal academy in their ignorance of the perspectives and experiences of rural Americans. No empirical study has systemically considered or acknowledged the role of community size in understanding when and why Americans turn to the bankruptcy system. Until now, the plight of rural families has been ignored. Overlooking the rural experience has impoverished our understanding of the financial pressures facing Americans. Without knowledge about rural Americans, who make up one-fifth of the U.S. population, our collective knowledge about the bankruptcy system generally and the economic pressure on all families is deeply flawed.     
The original data developed in this Article reveal that rural America is home to extraordinary, unexplored economic distress. Contrary to conceptions about a rural cultural resistance to debt and the pastoral nature of rural life, rural families appear to be facing more severe financial hardship than their urban counterparts. The bankruptcy data reveal the depth and nature of the financial squeeze on rural families. Rural Americans live in areas where low wages and reduced job opportunities leave them with smaller incomes, but at the same time, they pay the same or higher prices for many of the same goods and services that urban Americans do. This is the worst of both worlds. Rural households have fewer dollars to spend and more demands on those dollars - both from past debts and current expenses. The nature of rural bankruptcies reflects the declining rural economy and the losing struggle of rural families who are trying to make ends meet despite severe income, job and medical problems. Far from being immune from the financial pressures on American households, rural families inhabit the deepest hollows in a map of economic well-being.  Exploring this terrain offers critical insights on legal scholarship and bankruptcy policy.     
The data presented in this Article expose important differences in the economics of bankrupt families that correlate with place of residence. Because these differences between urban and rural families have gone unexplored until now, our understanding of the bankruptcy system has been distorted. This distortion is more pernicious because scholars have frequently failed to acknowledge their urban bias. In showing how rural residence creates differences among bankruptcy filers, this Article exposes the need to consider rural perspectives in studies of all legal fields. Exploring how the role of place shapes use of the legal system opens up a new way to flush out variations in how laws actually operate. My conclusions suggest that future legal scholarship in all disciplines should be cognizant of the ways in which rurality, like race, gender, non-citizen status, or age, may influence perspectives on law.     
The suffering of rural families revealed in the bankruptcy data has powerful implications for our understanding of the American economy as a whole. Learning how the economics of rural failure differ from that identified in urban areas allows a critical evaluation of how prior studies may have underreported the financial distress of bankrupt families by overlooking place of residence as a relevant factor. The rural bankruptcy data also offer a compelling example of the need for specialized rural policy in America. These findings highlight the need to build a healthy rural economy and offers insights into the problems that push rural families to bankruptcy, a financial breaking point.

	",34.0,"This article, the second in a trilogy, interprets American ownership-spreading programs past and present under the aspect of a comprehensive theory of ""the American ownership society"" (OS) developed in its predecessor article, titled Whose Ownership?  Which Society?  It also identifies what appears to be a significant gap in our efforts to become a comprehensive OS thus far.      
By early in the 20th century, we had developed and implemented a number of highly innovative and successful programs dedicated to the task of spreading human and nonhuman capital (in the form of arable land in particular) quite broadly.  Since about the 1930s, however, small-parceled land has receded in importance as a form of nonhuman capital such as can underwrite productive autonomy; and we now lack the land to dole out in that fashion in any event.  To complete our OS in the manner that we began to do seriously in the late 19th century, we must turn to the prospect of spreading the ownership of business firms.  Our home-spreading and education-spreading programs have modernized over the course of the later 20th and early 21st centuries in tandem with the modernization of finance technologies.  Our share-spreading programs have not.      
The article accordingly surveys and preliminarily assesses some early proposals to spread shares in firms by means analogous to those employed to spread homes and educations.  In doing so it also looks ahead to its sequel, which is devoted to updating those early proposals in a manner more sober than that of the earlier proposers.

	",,"In 1906 the U.S. Congress passed An Act Creating a United States Court for China and prescribing the jurisdiction thereof. The new court, equivalent to a federal district court, assumed civil and criminal jurisdiction over American citizens within the District of China which in turn was coincident with the Empire of China. Appeals from the court were taken to the Ninth Judicial Circuit in San Francisco, with further appeals to the United States Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. Expanding its original mandate, the court eventually construed its jurisdiction to include not only American citizens in the District of China but also American subjects from the Philippines and Guam, and in some cases American citizens who had never even been to China. The law applied by the court consisted of an extraordinary mix of colonial common law as it existed prior to American independence, general congressional acts, the municipal code of the District of Columbia, and the code of the territory of Alaska (parts of which continued being applied in China even after they were repealed in Alaska), to mention only the main sources of the court's jurisprudence. The court had only one judge, and when he was away (either riding circuit in the cities of Hankow, Tientsin, or Canton, or being investigated for official misconduct in Washington), prisoners sometimes had to wait for months for a trial. Indeed, virtually the only federal law that did not apply in the District of China was the United States Constitution: there was no right to a jury trial nor to constitutional due process, for example.     
This may all sound rather like a chapter from Alice in Wonderland - the kind of befuddled jurisprudence one might expect to emerge from the courtroom of the Queen of Hearts, not from a court of the United States. Yet the above description is in fact a brief summary of the jurisprudence of the American extraterritorial court in Shanghai, known simply and immodestly as the United States Court for China. It operated for several decades, and was not abolished until 1943.     
Even among its contemporaries, the court was not well known; from time to time, Congress itself forgot about its own creation. Those who became aware of the court's existence were as startled and intrigued as today's observers. A central goal of this Article is to rescue the U.S. Court for China from such oblivion. Although the court was likely the strangest federal tribunal ever constituted by Congress, it remains little known among legal scholars and China specialists alike, both in the United States as well as in China, and its jurisprudential and political significance remain almost entirely unexplored. In addition to its intrinsic historical significance, the court's functioning provides also a window into understanding the interaction between Chinese law and other legal systems. In the end, the story of the U.S. Court for China is part of the much larger, still on-going story of the introduction of Western international law into China. The ultimate ground for the court's stunning jurisdiction lay in the claim that China did not qualify for full membership in the Family of Nations, or Euro-American international society consisting of civilized states identified with their national legal systems.

	",8.0,"Americans care deeply about their Internet privacy. But if they want to know how federal law protects the privacy of their stored Internet communications, they'll quickly learn that it's surprisingly difficult to figure out. The federal statute that protects the privacy of stored Internet communications is the Stored Communications Act (SCA), passed as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 and codified at 18 U.S.C. section 2701-11. But courts, legislators, and even legal scholars have had a very hard time understanding the method behind the madness of the SCA. The statute is dense and confusing, and that confusion has made it difficult for legislators to legislate in the field, reporters to report about it, and scholars to write scholarship in this very important area.  
This Article presents a user's guide to the SCA. It explains in relatively simple terms the structure and text of the Act so that legislators, courts, academics, and students can understand how it works - and in some cases, how it doesn't work. I hope to explain the basic nuts and bolts of the statute and show that the statute works reasonably effectively, although certainly not perfectly. My second goal is to show how Congress needs to amend the SCA. I  recommend three ways that Congress should rethink the SCA to better protect the privacy of stored Internet communications, clarify its protections, and update the statute for the present. Specifically, I argue that Congress should raise the threshold the government must satisfy to compel the contents of certain Internet communications; that it should simplify the statute dramatically by eliminating the confusing categories of electronic communication service and remote computing service, and eliminating redundant text; and that it should restructure the remedies scheme for violations of the statute.

	",28.0,"This essay will reconsider the fundamentals of obscenity law: the harm that the law addresses and the means by which the law tries to prevent that harm. Strangely, even though an enormous amount of scholarship examines this doctrine, these fundamentals have not been adequately addressed. The harm that the doctrine seeks to prevent is not offense to unwilling viewers. It is not incitement to violence against women. It is not promotion of sexism. Rather, it is moral harm - a concept that modern scholarship finds hard to grasp.    
Liberals have not even understood the concept of moral harm, and so their arguments have often missed the point of the laws they were criticizing. Conservatives have understood the concept quite well, but have thought that it straightway entailed censorship. This essay is, to my knowledge, the first presentation of the liberal argument that does justice to the conservative case for censorship.    
I will argue that the concept is a coherent one and that obscenity law tries to prevent a genuine evil. But I will conclude that the law is too crude a tool for the task. A sound understanding of obscenity law's ambitions reveals that the doctrine is unworkable and should be abandoned.

	",,"The Financial Instability Hypothesis (FIH) has both empirical and theoretical aspects that challenge the classic precepts of Smith and Walras, who implied that the economy can be best understood by assuming that it is constantly an equilibrium-seeking and sustaining system. The theoretical argument of the FIH emerges from the characterization of the economy as a capitalist economy with extensive capital assets and a sophisticated financial system.    
In spite of the complexity of financial relations, the key determinant of system behavior remains the level of profits: the FIH incorporates a view in which aggregate demand determines profits. Hence, aggregate profits equal aggregate investment plus the government deficit. The FIH, therefore, considers the impact of debt on system behavior and also includes the manner in which debt is validated.    
Minsky identifies hedge, speculative, and Ponzi finance as distinct income-debt relations for economic units. He asserts that if hedge financing dominates, then the economy may well be an equilibrium-seeking and containing system: conversely, the greater the weight of speculative and Ponzi finance, the greater the likelihood that the economy is a ""deviation-amplifying"" system. Thus, the FIH suggests that over periods of prolonged prosperity, capitalist economies tend to move from a financial structure dominated by hedge finance (stable) to a structure that increasingly emphasizes speculative and Ponzi finance (unstable). The FIH is a model of a capitalist economy that does not rely on exogenous shocks to generate business cycles of varying severity: business cycles of history are compounded out of (i) the internal dynamics of capitalist economies, and (ii) the system of interventions and regulations that are designed to keep the economy operating within reasonable bounds.

	",34.0,"This paper argues that once undistorted shareholder choice is ensured - which can be done by making it necessary for hostile bidders to win a vote of shareholder support - boards should not have veto power over takeover bids. The paper considers all of the arguments that have been offered for board veto - including ones based on analogies to other corporate decisions, directors' superior information, bargaining by management, pressures on managers to focus on the short-run, inferences from IPO charters, interests of long-term shareholders, aggregate shareholder wealth, and protection of stakeholders. Examining these arguments both at the level of theory and in light of all available empirical evidence, the paper concludes that none of them individually, nor all of them taken together, warrants a board veto.

We then apply the Birthdate Problem to a pressing legal and public policy debate concerning allegations of widespread double voting and/or multiple registration.

	",45.0,"This paper reconsiders the basic allocation of power between boards and shareholders in publicly traded companies with dispersed ownership.  U.S. corporate law has long precluded shareholders from initiating any changes in the company's basic governance arrangements.  I show, and support with empirical evidence, that shareholders' existing power to replace directors is insufficient to secure the adoption of value-increasing governance arrangements that management disfavors. I put forward an alternative regime that would allow shareholders to initiate and adopt rules-of-the-game decisions to change the company's charter or state of incorporation. Providing shareholders with such power would improve over time to improve all corporate governance arrangements, largely by inducing management to initiate value-increasing changes and without shareholders' having to exercise their power to intervene.  
Furthermore, I argue that, as part of their power to amend governance arrangements, shareholders should be able to adopt provisions that give them additional power to intervene, down the road, in specific business decisions.  Power to intervene in game-ending decisions (to merge, sell all assets, or dissolve) could address management's bias in favor of the company's continued existence.  Power to intervene in scaling-down decisions (to make cash or in-kind distributions) could address management's tendency to retain excessive funds and engage in empire-building. Shareholders' ability to adopt, when necessary, provisions that give themselves additional power to intervene could thus produce benefits in many companies.    
A regime with shareholder power to intervene, I show, would address governance problems that have long troubled legal scholars and financial economists.  These benefits would result mainly from inducing management to act in ways that better serve shareholder interests and without shareholders' having to exercise their power to intervene. I also discus how such a regime could best be designed to address concerns that supporters of management insulation could raise; for example, to allay such concerns, shareholder-initiated changes in governance arrangements could be adopted only if they enjoy shareholder support in two consecutive annual meetings.   
Finally, examining a wide range of possible objections, I conclude that they do not provide a good basis for opposing the proposed increase in shareholder power.

	",33.0,"This paper analyzes the history of federal intervention in corporate law and draws from it lessons for the future. We show that federal intervention has generally not alternated between tightening state law restrictions on corporate insiders and relaxing them. Rather, federal law has systematically replaced state law arrangements with ones imposing tighter constraints on insiders. Without federal intervention, state law would have produced a corporate system that provides substantially weaker investor protection than the United States enjoys today. We also show that federal interventions have systematically taken advantage of additional tools (including public enforcement, criminal sanctions, gatekeeper liability, and agency-based regulations) beyond those that state law has chosen or been able to use. Overall, unless one views existing levels of investor protection as substantially excessive, past patterns suggest that state competition on its own is unlikely to produce an adequate level of investor protection. Furthermore, the recurring need for federal officials to rectify state law failures in order to provide investors with adequate protection indicates that federal lawmaking should be proactive rather than reactive. We thus recommend that, going forward, federal policymakers examine in a systematic and comprehensive fashion which corporate law areas should be federalized either because tighter restrictions on insiders are needed or because the additional tools available to federal law would be useful.

	",51.0,"There has been much research and conjecture concerning the barriers women face in trying to climb the corporate ladder, with evidence suggesting that they typically confront a 'glass ceiling' while men are more likely to benefit from a 'glass escalator'. But what happens when women do achieve leadership roles? And what sorts of positions are they given? This paper argues that while women are now achieving more high profile positions, they are more likely than men to find themselves on a 'glass cliff', such that their positions are risky or precarious. This hypothesis was investigated in an archival study examining the performance of FTSE 100 companies before and after the appointment of a male or female board member. The study revealed that during a period of overall stock-market decline those companies who appointed women to their boards were more likely to have experienced consistently bad performance in the preceding five months than those who appointed men. These results expose an additional, largely invisible, hurdle that women need to overcome in the workplace. Implications for the evaluation of women leaders are discussed and directions for future research are outlined.

	",38.0,"Tiebout's (1956) suggestion that people ""vote with their feet"" to find the community that provides their optimal bundle of taxes and public goods has played a central role in the theory of local public finance over the past 50 years. Given the central importance of Tiebout's insights, there have been surprisingly few direct tests of his premise. In this paper, we use a Tiebout equilibrium model to derive testable hypotheses about changes in local community demographics. The model clearly predicts increased population density in neighborhoods that experience an exogenous increase in public goods but yields only tentative predictions about the effect on neighborhood composition. To test these hypotheses, we use a difference-in-difference model to identify the effect of initial pollution levels and changes in local pollution on population and demographic composition. Our results provide strong empirical support for the notion that households ""vote with their feet"" in response to changes in environmental quality. This result has two implications. First, and most broadly, it provides direct empirical support for the assumptions underlying the Tiebout model. Second, in our particular application, the potential for what we call ""environmental gentrification"" has important implications both for the analysis of environmental equity and for the design of environmental policies aimed at benefiting the less-advantaged elements of society.

	",124.0,"Corporate reputation has attracted interest from a wide range of academic disciplines. It is also a growing focus for business and media attention. This paper examines the construct of corporate reputation, first by untangling the terminological problems that have been caused by the interdisciplinary nature of much of the earlier work in the area. The construct of reputation and the allied constructs of image and identity are each reviewed. A structure is proposed in which the three constructs can be seen as labelling different but allied concepts. I then move on to consider how reputation has been measured. The paper uncovers considerable confusion in the use of what might appear to be basic terms and links this to a subsequent lack of grounded measurement tools in the sector, until relatively recently. With a clearer understanding of the construct of corporate reputation and the allied constructs of image and identity, researchers are now well placed to test the relationships widely claimed by practitioners between corporate reputation and other variables such as commercial performance and employee and customer satisfaction. The review ends by illustrating some of the issues that can be assessed from the basis of a clearer conceptualization of reputation and its measurement.

	",38.0,"In the 2004 presidential election, the United States came much closer to electoral meltdown, violence in the streets, and constitutional crisis than most people realize. Less than a 2% swing among Ohio voters toward Democratic candidate for President John Kerry and away from incumbent Republican President George W. Bush would have placed the Ohio - and national - election for president well within the margin of litigation, and it would have gotten ugly very quickly. Allegations of voter fraud and voter suppression were rampant on both sides, and even though Kerry conceded the election on the day after Election Day, public confidence in the U.S. system of American administration is now quite low. Previously unpublished data demonstrate that there is a growing partisan divide over views of the fairness of the election process.  
The bad news from the story of Election 2004 is that things likely won't get better in 2008. As Part I details, the extreme partisanship and close division of the American electorate, coupled with the Electoral College system, make the possibility of another razor-close presidential election in one or more battleground states fairly likely. Add to that mix election administration incompetence and a widely decentralized system of election administration with a patchwork of inconsistent rules. What's worse, since Bush v. Gore, losing candidates have become more willing to resort to election law as part of a political strategy: the number of election-law related cases in the lower courts has risen dramatically compared to the period before the case. It all adds up to a recipe for electoral meltdown.  
In Part II of this Article, I argue for three reforms that could significantly lower the risk of electoral meltdown. First, I advocate registration reform, in particular universal voter registration conducted by the government coupled with a voter identification program. There has been a wide partisan divide in the election administration debate between Democrats who have expressed concern about voter suppression and Republicans who have expressed concern about voter fraud. The registration reform I advocate can alleviate both of those concerns, minimize the potential for and political rhetoric regarding voter fraud, and eliminate a great majority of potential litigation surrounding presidential election administration  
Second, I advocate a transition to nonpartisan election administration. The nonpartisan solution aims to create both the actuality and appearance of neutrality in election administration, thereby bolstering the public's faith in the process. Australia and Canada serve as good models for reform in this regard, though not necessarily their nationalization of election administration. I consider how to assure that U.S. election administrators are truly nonpartisan, and contrast arguments for nonpartisan election administration with calls for nonpartisan redistricting commissions and campaign finance enforcement.  
Third, I discuss the role of the courts in minimizing electoral meltdown. The key here is to encourage courts to be more willing to entertain pre-election litigation and much more chary of entertaining post-election litigation. To the extent election administration problems can be recognized in advance, pre-election judicial review prevents future harm from occurring, rather than putting courts in the position of trying to undo the bad effects of a past harm. The costs of post-election review are large: the pressure put on courts to decide arcane election law questions when the outcome of an election - especially a presidential election - is huge, and the appearance of partisan decisionmaking is inevitable.

	",42.0,"Results of past research suggest that affect plays an important role in risk perception. Because affect may also increase the availability of risks, affect and availability are closely related concepts. Three studies tested the hypothesis that evoking negative affect (fear), either through past experience or through experimental manipulation, results in greater perceived risk. The present research focused on perception of flooding risk. Study 1 and Study 2 showed that participants who received risk information concerning a longer time period (e.g., 30 years) perceived more danger compared with participants who received risk information for one year. Study 2 showed that the interpretation of risk information was influenced by participants' own experiences with flooding. In Study 3, affect was experimentally manipulated. After looking at photographs depicting houses in a flooded region, participants perceived greater risk compared with participants in a control group. Taken together, the results of these three studies suggest that affect is important for successful risk communication. Results of the present research are in line with the affect heuristic proposed by Slovic and colleagues.

	",,"The electronic processing of health information provides considerable benefits to patients and health care providers at the same time that it creates serious risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.  The Internet provides a conduit for rapid and uncontrolled dispersion and trafficking of illicitly-obtained private health information, with far-reaching consequences to the unsuspecting victims.  In order to address such threats to electronic private health information, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services enacted the HIPAA Security Rule, which thus far has received little attention in the legal literature.  This article presents a critique of the Security Rule from both legal and technical perspectives.  We argue that the Rule suffers from several defects relating to its narrow definition of ""covered entities,"" to the limited scope of information it allows data subjects to obtain about their health information, to the vagueness and incompleteness of the Rule's standards and implementation specifications, and to the lack of a private cause of action.  The article explores the difficult problem of crafting static regulations to adequately address rapidly  changing computer and communications technologies and associated security threats to private health information.  In addition, it develops detailed recommendations for improving safeguards for electronically processed health records.

	",100.0,"This Article examines the complex world of Internet search. The Article seeks to ensure that trademark law does not interfere with the free flow of Internet content that consumers find relevant.    
The Article starts with three complementary looks at Internet search from the perspectives of searchers, publishers and search providers. From the searcher's perspective, the Article explains how searchers select keywords poorly and decontextualized keywords provide inadequate insight into the searcher's true objectives.    
From the publisher's perspective, the Article discusses how publishers try to anticipate search keywords and provide responsive content.    
From the search provider's perspective, the Article shows that search providers are not passive intermediaries manipulated by deceptive publishers. Instead, search providers actively mediate the relationship between searchers and publishers, often modifying searcher keywords and publisher content to facilitate a match. The Article also explains that all search providers use keywords to make those matches, and the emergence of keyword-driven searches has eliminated any meaningful distinctions between domain names, metatags and keyword-triggered ads.    
Based on this factual foundation, the Article looks at Internet trademark law. The Article particularly scrutinizes the initial interest confusion doctrine, showing its doctrinal deficiencies. The Article concludes with several proposals:    
1) Trademark infringement analysis should be moved to later stages of a searcher's search process because harms at earlier stages are too speculative.    
2) The traditional likelihood of consumer confusion test should be updated to include a factor that considers the relevancy of content presented to searchers.    
3) Search providers should be given a safe harbor from liability to encourage them to do the best job possible at delivering relevant content to searchers.

	",15.0,"This article argues for a comprehensive framework for the source and allocation of the foreign affairs powers of the U.S. government, based on the text of the Constitution.  Modern  scholarship, we believe, has too quickly given up on the Constitution's text as a tool for resolving foreign affairs controversies.  This scholarship would have one believe that the Constitution contains enormous gaps and omissions in foreign affairs that must be filled by extratextual sources.  In particular, the text is seen as largely unhelpful in addressing three seemingly intractable puzzles:  (i) what is the source of foreign affairs powers conventionally believed to lie with the President - to direct and recall diplomats and act as the ""sole organ"" of communications with foreign nations - but apparently beyond the President's explicit textual powers; (ii) what is the source of Congress' authority to regulate foreign affairs matters, such as the activities of U.S. citizens abroad, that do not seem encompassed by Congress' enumerated powers; and (iii) how should one assess the source and allocation of foreign affairs powers not specifically mentioned in the text and claimed by both the President and Congress, such as the power to set foreign policy, enter into executive agreements, and terminate treaties.  
We argue that the constitutional text, properly interpreted, provides a sound guide for resolving these matters.  We derive four basic principles from the textual treatment of foreign affairs.  First, the President has a ""residual"" foreign affairs power from Article II, Section 1's grant of ""the executive Power.""  The executive power, as described by political theorists consulted by the framers - such as Locke, Montesquieu and Blackstone - included foreign affairs power.  By using a common phrase infused with that meaning, the Constitution establishes a presumption that the President has the foreign affairs powers traditionally part of the executive power.  Second, the framers thought the traditional executive had too great a power over foreign affairs, so they specifically allocated many key powers, in whole or in part, to other branches: war, commerce, treatymaking, etc.  These are allocations away from the President, and thus, despite having the  ""executive Power,"" the President cannot claim independent authority in these areas: the executive power over foreign affairs is only residual, extending to matters not otherwise covered in the text.  Third, Congress has no general power over foreign affairs, but it has two textual sources of foreign affairs power: powers specifically given to it (such as war and commerce), and its power to carry into execution powers granted to other branches by the Constitution.  The latter is a derivative power exercisable in conjunction with the President, to give effect to the President's executive power over foreign affairs.  Finally, the President has broad residual power over foreign affairs, but that power does not extend to matters not part of the traditional executive power.  Accordingly, the President cannot claim lawmaking or appropriations power in foreign affairs.  
Having described these textual principles, we test our reading against the actual practice of the Washington administration.  We find that this practice corresponded closely with the model we have derived from the text.  President Washington exercised broad powers in foreign affairs without specific textual authorization, and without raising any serious objections.  Washington, however, also observed the limits on the executive power over foreign affairs we suggest: he did not claim powers specifically allocated to other branches, nor did he claim lawmaking or appropriations power in support of his foreign affairs powers.

However, many legal, political and social problems have not yet been tackled in terms of achieving real implementation of WTO provisions throughout the territory of the People's Republic of China. The Protocol requires a general and deep application of transparency, which will radically influence and change the Chinese legal system. There are a wide range of transparency related problems such as the formal publication of laws and regulations, procedural fairness in decision-making, the judicial review and the non-discrimination principle. The special precautionary instrument, the Transitional Review Mechanism (TRM), was included in the Protocol of China's Accession to the WTO, as requested by the US and supported by the EU. The TRM has the objective of monitoring and enforcement of implementation of WTO commitments, promoting transparency and the exchange of information in trade relations with China. Bilateral engagements and multilateral forums are both essential to bring China into full compliance with its WTO commitments.

	",68.0,"American political institutions were founded upon the Madisonian  assumption of vigorous, self-sustaining political competition between the legislative and executive branches. Congress and the President would check and balance each other; officeholders would defend the distinct interests of their distinct institutions; ambition would counteract ambition. To this day, the idea of building self-sustaining political competition into the structure of government is frequently portrayed as the unique genius of the U.S. Constitution and largely credited for the success of American democracy. Yet the truth is closer to the opposite. The success of American democracy overwhelmed the branch-based design of separation of powers almost from the outset, preempting the political dynamics that were supposed to provide each branch with a will of its own. What the Framers did not count on was the emergence of robust democratic competition, in government and in the electorate. Political competition and cooperation along relatively stable lines of policy and ideological disagreement quickly came to be channeled not through the branches of government but rather through an institution the Framers could imagine only dimly but nevertheless despised: political parties. Parties quickly came to serve as the primary organizational vehicle for mobilizing, motivating, and defining the terms of democratic political competition, creating alliances among constituents and officeholders that cut across the boundaries between the branches and undermined Madisonian assumptions of branch-based competition.      
Few aspects of the Founding generation's political theory are now more clearly anachronistic than their vision of legislative-executive separation of powers. Nevertheless, few of the Framers' ideas continue to be taken as literally or sanctified as deeply by courts and constitutional scholars as the passages about interbranch relations in Madison's Federalist 51. This Article reenvisions the law and theory of separation of powers by viewing it through the lens of party competition. In particular, it points out that during periods - like the present - of cohesive and polarized political parties, the degree and kind of competition between the legislative and executive branches will vary significantly, and may all but disappear, depending on whether party control of the House, Senate, and Presidency is divided or unified. The practical distinction between party-divided and party-unified government thus rivals, and often dominates, the constitutional distinction between the branches in predicting and explaining interbranch political dynamics. Recognizing that these dynamics will shift from competitive when government is divided to cooperative when it is unified calls into question basic assumptions of separation of powers law and theory. More constructively, re-focusing the separation of powers on parties casts numerous aspects of constitutional structure, doctrine, and institutional design in a new and more realistic light.

These excess returns result from strong positive momentum of index deletions and poor long-run returns of new issue additions. We also document the influence of index changes on small-cap equity fund returns. Index deletions enhance the benchmark-adjusted returns of the strongest performing funds by an average of 1.45% per year. Among weaker performing funds, the benefits from holding index deletions are offset by the poor returns of new issues added to the index, which the stronger performing funds generally avoid.

This article assesses two measures frequently cited to support a bubble - the rising price-to-income ratio and the declining rent-to-price ratio - and finds the measures to be flawed and the conclusions drawn from them unpersuasive. In particular, the measures do not fully account for the effects of declining nominal mortgage interest rates and fail to use appropriate home price indexes. The authors also estimate a structural model of the housing market and find that aggregate prices are not inconsistent with long-run demand fundamentals. Accordingly, they conclude that market fundamentals are strong enough to explain the recent path of home prices and that no bubble exists. Nevertheless, weakening fundamentals could have an impact on home values on the east and west coasts, where the new housing supply appears to be relatively inelastic. However, prices in these regions have typically been volatile, and previous declines have not had a sizable negative effect on the overall economy.

	",,"This paper shows that most of the large recent increases in campaign spending for Federal and state offices can be explained by higher government spending. This result holds for both Federal and state legislative campaigns and gubernatorial races and across many different specifications. Evidence is also examined on whether it is the composition and not just the level of expenditures which determines campaign expenditures and whether higher government expenditures similarly results in more candidates competing for office. The data provide some indication that legislative term limits reduce campaign expenditures and increase the number of candidates running for office. Finally, by focusing on the symptoms and not the root causes of ever higher campaign expenditures, this paper argues that the current public policy debate risks changing the form that payments are made rather than actually restricting the level of competition.

A value-weighted portfolio of the ""100 Best Companies to Work For in America"" earned an annual four-factor alpha of 3.5% from 1984-2009, and 2.1% above industry benchmarks. The results are robust to controls for firm characteristics, different weighting methodologies and the removal of outliers. The Best Companies also exhibited significantly more positive earnings surprises and announcement returns. These findings have three main implications. First, consistent with human capital-centered theories of the firm, employee satisfaction is positively correlated with shareholder returns and need not represent managerial slack. Second, the stock market does not fully value intangibles, even when independently verified by a highly public survey on large firms. Third, certain socially responsible investing (""SRI"") screens may improve investment returns.

	",72.0,"An availability cascade is a self-reinforcing process of collective belief formation by which an expressed perception triggers a chain reaction that gives the perception of increasing plausibility through its rising availability in public discourse. The driving mechanism involves a combination of informational and reputational motives: Individuals endorse the perception partly by learning from the apparent beliefs of others and partly by distorting their public responses in the interest of maintaining social acceptance. Availability entrepreneurs - activists who manipulate the content of public discourse - strive to trigger availability cascades likely to advance their agendas. Their availability campaigns may yield social benefits, but sometimes they bring harm, which suggests a need for safeguards. Focusing on the role of mass pressures in the regulation of risks associated with production, consumption, and the environment, Professor Timur Kuran and Cass R. Sunstein analyze availability cascades and suggest reforms to alleviate their potential hazards. Their proposals include new governmental structures designed to give civil servants better insulation against mass demands for regulatory change and an easily accessible scientific database to reduce people's dependence on popular (mis)perceptions.

	",5.0,"Paying top executives better would eventually mean paying them more. The arrival of spring means yet another round in the national debate over executive compensation. Soon the business press will trumpet answers to the questions it asks every year: Who were the highest paid CEOs? How many executives made more than a million dollars? Who received the biggest raises? Political figures, union leaders, and consumer activists will issue now-familiar denunciations of executive salaries and urge that directors curb top-level pay in the interests of social equity and statesmanship. The critics have it wrong. There are serious problems with CEO compensation, but excessive pay is not the biggest issue. The relentless focus on how much CEOs are paid diverts public attention from the real problem--how CEOs are paid. In most publicly held companies, the compensation of top executives is virtually independent of performance. On average, corporate America pays its most important leaders like bureaucrats. Is it any wonder then that so many CEOs act like bureaucrats rather than the value-maximizing entrepreneurs companies need to enhance their standing in world markets? We recently completed an in-depth statistical analysis of executive compensation. Our study incorporates data on thousands of CEOs spanning five decades. The base sample consists of information on salaries and bonuses for 2,505 CEOs in 1,400 publicly held companies from 1974 through 1988. We also collected data on stock options and stock ownership for CEOs of the 430 largest publicly held companies in 1988. In addition, we drew on compensation data for executives at more than 700 public companies for the period 1934 through 1938.

About 12,000 people call this place their permanent home, although some 60,000 are present there at any given time. The nominal hourly wage is about USD 3.42 per hour, and the labors of the people produce a GNP per capita somewhere between that of Russia and Bulgaria. A unit of Norrath's currency is traded on exchange markets at USD 0.0107, higher than the Yen and the Lira. The economy is characterized by extreme inequality, yet life there is quite attractive to many. The population is growing rapidly, swollen each each day by hundreds of emigres from various places around the globe, but especially the United States. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the new world is its location. Norrath is a virtual world that exists entirely on 40 computers in San Diego. Unlike many internet ventures, virtual worlds are making money -- with annual revenues expected to top USD 1.5 billion by 2004 -- and if network effects are as powerful here as they have been with other internet innovations, virtual worlds may soon become the primary venue for all online activity.

	",21.0,"This Essay examines whether children born here to illegal immigrants are citizens of the United States. Though longstanding practice supports citizenship under these circumstances, critics like Peter Schuck, Rogers Smith, and Richard Posner argue that the subject to the jurisdiction language in the Fourteenth Amendment can be construed to exclude these children. For the most part, this claim draws on the debates surrounding the exclusion of the Native American Tribes from birthright citizenship, which was the primary object of subject to the jurisdiction language.  
In reviewing (and rejecting) this revisionist argument, the Essay makes two significant points. First, the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment excluded the Tribes from equal citizenship because that was inconsistent with the autonomy they were promised in Worcester v. Georgia. Consequently, the Citizenship Clause in this respect was a necessary evil that should not be extended by construction to cover illegal immigrants. Second, the appropriate analogy for this problem is not the Tribes, but the traditional common-law exception from birthright citizenship for enemy aliens in hostile occupation. The operative question for establishing jurisdiction in a constitutional sense when foreign invaders are involved is whether we can exercise a minimal level of enforcement of its authority. With respect to illegal immigrants and their kids, the answer is yes.

Alternatively, the average monthly return to a momentum strategy for a quarter-ending month is 310 basis points. These patterns are strongest in securities with high levels of institutional ownership and in December.

	",46.0,"We present a framework and empirical estimates that quantify the economic impact of increased product variety made available through electronic markets. While efficiency gains from increased competition significantly enhance consumer surplus, for instance by leading to lower average selling prices, our present research shows that increased product variety made available through electronic markets can be a significantly larger source of consumer surplus gains.   
One reason for increased product variety on the Internet is the ability of online retailers to catalog, recommend and provide a large number of products for sale. For example, the number of book titles available at Amazon.com is over 23 times larger than the number of books on the shelves of a typical Barnes & Noble superstore and 57 times greater than the number of books stocked in a typical large independent bookstore.  
Our analysis indicates that the increased product variety of online bookstores enhanced consumer welfare by $731 million to $1.03 billion in the year 2000, which is between seven to ten times as large as the consumer welfare gain from increased competition and lower prices in this market. There may also be large welfare gains in other SKU-intensive consumer goods such as music, movies, consumer electronics, and computer software and hardware.

	",,"The Ottoman Empire's widespread persecution of Assyrian civilians during World War I constituted a form of genocide, the present-day term for an attempt to destroy a national, ethnic, or religious group, in whole or in part. Although there were no extermination camps on the scale of Auschwitz, the genocide of the Assyrians resembled the Holocaust of Jews, Slavs, Roma people, leftists, homosexuals, and other minorities under Nazi occupation during World War II because Ottoman soldiers and their Kurdish and Persian militia allies subjected hundreds of thousands of Assyrians to a deliberate and systematic campaign of massacre, torture, abduction, deportation, impoverishment, and cultural and ethnic destruction. According to the American ambassador to Constantinople from 1913 to 1916, Henry I. Morgenthau, widely regarded as a principal source of information on the Armenian genocide: ""The story which I have told about the Armenians I could also tell with certain modifications about the Greeks and the Syrians,"" as Assyrians were often known to the West. He added that the Ottoman Empire ""decided to apply the same methods [of ""wholesale massacre""] on a larger scale not only to the Greeks but to the Armenians, Syrians, Nestorians [i.e., Assyrians], and others of its subject peoples."" In 1918, according to the Los Angeles Times, Ambassador Morgenthau confirmed that the Ottoman Empire had ""massacred fully 2,000,000 men, women, and childrenÂ¿Greeks, Assyrians, Armenians; fully 1,500,000 Armenians.""  
This article will argue that the hesitation to recognize the Assyrian genocide is unjustified, for the evidence is overwhelming that Turks and their Kurdish allies massacred hundreds of thousands of Assyrians in order to exterminate the Christian population; raped and enslaved thousands of Assyrian women in a systematic fashion; and deported the Assyrians en masse from their ancestral lands under conditions that led to famine and widespread death. Established principles of international law outlawed this war of extermination against Ottoman Christian civilians before it was embarked upon, and ample evidence of genocidal intent has surfaced in the form of admissions by Ottoman officials. Nevertheless, the international community has been hesitant to recognize the Assyrian experience as an instance of genocide. The more rapid legal recognition of the Armenian genocide is attributable to the larger numbers of Armenian victims and survivors, the dispersion and political voicelessness of the Assyrian people, and more copious evidence of an intention on the part of the Ottomans to wipe out the Armenians.  
In conclusion, I will contend that the legal and historical recognition of the Assyrian genocide at the hands of the Ottomans is vital to focus the world's attention on the Assyrian remnant in Iraq. That remnant has been scattered by more than a century of massacre, discrimination, and religious persecution into non-viable communities that are still waiting for their homelands and human rights to be restored. U.S. officials have documented an ""ethnic-cleansing campaign"" against Assyrians in present-day Iraq, with ""systematic attacks"" against Assyrian civilians, bombings of Assyrian churches, and the driving of most Assyrians out of Iraq. Genocide and ethnic cleansing give rise to legally enforceable claims for reparation and restoration of property and the value of lives lost. But because their genocide has rarely been recognized, the Assyrians driven from their homes over the past century have received relatively little by way of compensation or assistance with rebuilding. This article calls upon the international community to focus its efforts on the security and resettlement of the Assyrian people.

Through a technical re-analysis of both the internal and external validity criteria for test bias using data reported in the Rushton et al. paper, we demonstrate that the Raven's Matrices test is in fact biased against Black Africans. We take issue with several additional elements of Rushton et al.'s study, including the use of non-equivalent groups in test samples. We briefly review Rushton's racial-realist research agenda and show that the assumption of test bias is central to advancing that agenda. Industrial/organizational and occupational psychologists should critically analyze and re-evaluate the science employed in Rushton's racial-realist research and also should better understand the ethical and social implications of accepting his reports of research findings on test bias and White-Black IQ differences as established scientific facts.

	",56.0,"This paper investigates the relation between lunar phases and stock market returns of 48 countries. The findings indicate that stock returns are lower on the days around a full moon than on the days around a new moon. The magnitude of the return difference is 3% to 5% per annum based on analyses of two global portfolios: one equal-weighted and the other value-weighted. The return difference is not due to changes in stock market volatility or trading volumes.

	",44.0,"This paper investigates empirically how the value of publicly traded firms is affected by arrangements that protect management from removal. Staggered boards, which a majority of U.S. public companies have, substantially insulate boards from removal in either a hostile takeover or a proxy contest. We find that staggered boards are associated with an economically meaningful reduction in firm value (as measured by Tobin's Q). We also provide suggestive evidence that staggered boards bring about, and not merely reflect, an economically significant reduction in firm value. Finally, the correlation with reduced firm value is stronger for staggered boards that are established in the corporate charter (which shareholders cannot amend) than for staggered boards established in the company's bylaws (which shareholders can amend).The data on which this paper is based is available for download at Lucian Bebchuk's home page.This paper is listed in the Journal of Financial Economicsâ€™ â€œHall of Fameâ€ of influential JFE articles that have an average of 10 or more citations per year since publication.

	",59.0,"This article concerns the concepts of employee harm and harm avoidance within the liability framework for hostile work environment sexual harassment by a supervisor. Whether an employer is liable for supervisor sexual harassment depends in part on whether or not the employee avoids her harm or mitigates her damages resulting from the sexual harassment. Despite the law's interest in employee's harm avoidance, courts have failed to fully explore the vast array of harms resulting from sexual harassment and the variety of ways in which an employee avoids these multiple harms. This article reframes the legal discussion of an employee's actions in response to sexual harassment from one that almost exclusively focuses on whether the employee failed to report the sexual harassment. To assist in the reconceptualization, this article explores women employees' responses to sexual harassment: the ways in which they are harmed by sexual harassment, beyond the act of sexual harassment itself, and the ways in which they avoid that harm, beyond simply reporting the sexual harassment. There are at least two benefits from this reframing. First, a more inclusive depiction of women employees' injuries from and responses to sexual harassment would far better inform sexual harassment liability determinations. As a result, the determinations can fulfill the legislative intent of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to encourage and reinforce employees' efforts to ""avoid harm."" Second, through this process, there is an opportunity to reveal the existing reality that highlights women's partial agency but often is obscured with the dominant picture of a sexual harassment victim as ""suffering in silence.""

	",34.0,"Data from several investor surveys suggest that macroeconomic instability, investment restrictions, corruption and political instability have a negative impact on foreign direct investment (FDI) to Africa. However, the relationship between FDI and these country characteristics has not been studied. This paper uses panel data for 22 countries over the period 1984-2000 to examine the impact of natural resources, market size, government policies, political instability and the quality of the host country's institutions on FDI. It also analyses the importance of natural resources and market size  government policy and the host country's institutions in directing FDI flows. The main result is that natural resources and large markets promote FDI. However, lower inflation, good infrastructure, an educated population, openness to FDI, less corruption, political stability and a reliable legal system have a similar effect. A benchmark specification shows that a decline in the corruption from the level of Nigeria to that of South Africa has the same positive effect on FDI as increasing the share of fuels and minerals in total exports by about 35 per cent. These results suggest that countries that are small or lack natural resources can attract FDI by improving their institutions and policy environment.

	",2.0,"In 1900 L. Frank Baum published a children's tale, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In it, a little  girl from the Midwest plains is transported by a tornado to the Land of Oz and accidentally kills the Wicked Witch of the East, setting the Munchkins free. Yearning to return home, she takes the witch's silver shoes and follows the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City, in search of the  Wizard who will help her. She and the companions she meets on her way ultimately discover that the wizard is a sham, and that the silver shoes alone could have returned her to Aunt Em.  Littlefield (1964) and Rockoff (1990) have decoded Baum's tale as an allegory on the monetary politics of late nineteenth century America. The silver shoes are the silver standard, the witch  of the East represents the ""monied interest"" of the East Coast, the scarecrow and the tin man are the farmers and workers of the Midwest, while the cowardly lion is their unsuccessful champion, William Jennings Bryan. The yellow brick road is the gold standard, whose fallacy is exposed by  Dorothy's triumphant return home borne by the silver shoes.    
William Jennings Bryan, as nominee of the Democratic Party in the presidential election of 1896, campaigned on a platform to reverse the so-called ""crime of 1873."" The phrase referred to the change in the United States' monetary system from bimetallism, in which gold and silver are used concurrently, to the gold standard. Bryan lost, and in 1900 a law was passed firmly committing the United States to the gold standard. The bimetallic controversy soon died away. The United States had taken the yellow brick road.    
In this article, I recount the historical background to the bimetallic controversy, replacing it in its international context. Bimetallism, which until 1873 had been the system in a number of other countries, disappeared abruptly. I use a model to understand how bimetallism could have been viable in the first place, why it disappeared so suddenly, and whether the United States could have taken another road.

	",,"The Supreme Court's recent decision in Gonzales v. Raich marks a watershed moment in the development of judicial federalism. If it has not quite put an end to the Rehnquist Court's ""federalism revolution,"" it certainly represents a major step in that direction. In this Article, I contend that Raich represents a major - possibly even terminal - setback for efforts to impose meaningful judicial constraints on Congress' Commerce Clause powers.    
Raich undermines judicial enforcement of federalism in three interlocking ways: by adopting an essentially limitless definition of economic activity thereby ensuring that virtually any activity can be aggregated to produce the ""substantial effect [on] interstate commerce"" required to legitimate congressional regulation under United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison; by making it easier for Congress to impose controls on even non-economic activity by claiming that it is part of a broader regulatory scheme; and finally, by restoring the so-called rational basis test, holding that ""[w]e need not determine whether [defendants'] activities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a rational basis exists for so concluding."" The Supreme Court's recent seemingly pro-federalism decisions in Gonzales v. Oregon and Rapanos v. Army Corps of Engineers actually do little or nothing to mitigate the impact of Raich.    
I also contend that the Raich decision is misguided on both textual and structural grounds. The text of the Constitution does not support the nearly unlimited congressional power endorsed in Raich. Such unlimited power also undercuts some of the major structural advantages of federalism, including diversity, the ability to ""vote with your feet,"" and interstate competition for residents.    
Raich's undercutting of federalism by upholding the power of Congress to ban the possession of homegrown medical marijuana closely parallels legal developments during the Prohibition era of the 1920s. In both periods, the establishment of a nationwide prohibition regime greatly eroded decentralized federalism, in part because the Supreme Court accepted the government's claims that the power to regulate a market in prohibited substances necessarily required comprehensive regulation of virtually all sale or possession of the commodities in question.    
The future of judicial federalism may depend not just on the precise doctrinal impact of Raich, but on the possibility that liberal jurists and political activists may come to recognize that they have an interest in limiting congressional power. A cross-ideological coalition for judicial enforcement of federalism would be far more formidable than today's narrow alliance between some conservatives and libertarians. Ironically, the Raich decision, in combination with other recent developments, may help bring about such a result.

	",32.0,"In this paper, we present a few simple market-timing strategies that appear to outperform the ""buy-and-hold"" strategy, with real-time data from 1970 to 2000.  Our focus is on spreads between the E/P ratio of the S&P 500 index and interest rates.  Extremely low spreads, as compared to their historical ranges, appear to predict higher frequencies of subsequent market downturns in monthly data.  We construct ""horse races"" between switching strategies based on extremely low spreads and the market index.  Switching strategies call for investing in the stock market index unless spreads are lower than predefined thresholds.

The formula which requests military commanders to take into account the damage to the civilian population of the enemy seems to be full of vague terms and undefined expressions. Using the conflict in Lebanon during the summer of 2006 as a case study, this comment offers a new look at the concept of proportionality. It suggests that much of the debates concerning proportionality emanate from different understandings of the term. The paper offers that in some situations states view proportionality as a form of reprisal. The paper also attempts an initial application of this explanation to the conflict in Lebanon.

In the 1950s, who but the most rampant optimist would have dreamed that, over the next fifty years, the real return on equities would be 9 percent per year? Yet this is exactly what happened in the US stock market.    
In this study we extend our knowledge of financial market performance across regions and across time. We present a comprehensive and consistent analysis of investment returns for equities, bonds, bills, currencies, and inflation, spanning sixteen countries from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twenty-first. Our indexes are chosen to avoid survivorship bias, and all returns include reinvested income. This enables us to study topics such as the size effect, the value premium, interest rates and inflation, dividend growth, and the equity risk premium over more than a century.    
The markets we cover comprise two in North America, seven in the Euro area, four others in Europe, two in the Asia-Pacific region, and one in Africa. We present in this extract from our work a summary of capital market history in all sixteen countries. We find that over the long haul stocks beat bonds in every market, and bonds beat bills almost everywhere.

Ultimately, the paper concludes that the varied uses of blood quantum reflect the changing policies of the federal government towards Indians through time and the continued failure to resolve two interlocking foundational contradictions of Indian legal status: 1) Indian as race and as political group, and 2) Indian as sovereign and as ward.

This paper uses unique data on the dental health of incoming Air Force personnel to analyze empirically  the effects of varying licensing stringency among the states.

	",,"Two of a number of hypotheses loosely referred to as the CSI Effect suggest that the television program and its spin-offs, which wildy exaggerate and glorify forensic science, affect the public, and in turn affect trials either by (a) burdening the prosecution by creating greater expectations about forensic science than can be delivered or (b) burden the defense by creating exaggerated faith in the capabilities and reliability of the forensic sciences. Surprisingly, no published empirical research puts these hypotheses to a test. The present study did so by presenting to mock jurors a simulated trial transcript which included the testimony of a forensic scientist. The case for conviction was relatively weak, unless the expert testimony could carry the case across the threshold of reasonable doubt. In addition to reacting to the trial evidence, respondents were asked about their television viewing habits. Findings: Compared to non-CSI viewers, CSI viewers were more critical of the forensic evidence presented at the trial, finding it less believable. Regarding their verdicts, 29% of non-CSI viewers said they would convict, compared to 18% of CSI viewers (not a statistically significant difference). Forensic science viewers expressed more confidence in their verdicts than did non-viewers. Viewers of general crime program, however, did not differ significantly from their non-viewing counterparts on any of the other dependent measures, suggesting that skepticism toward the forensic science testimony was specific to those whose diet consisted of heavy doses of forensic science television programs.

	",13.0,"The debate over the use of foreign law on the U.S. Supreme Court is a part of a much larger constitutional conversation occurring in many jurisdictions regarding the migration of constitutional ideas. The migration of constitutional ideas across legal systems is rapidly emerging as one of the central features of contemporary constitutional practice. The migration of constitutional ideas has been identified to a limited extent at a descriptive level. But many basic conceptual issues have received almost no attention in the large and growing critical literature on comparative constitutional law. For example, the existing literature has not addressed systematically the methodology of constitutional migration, nor the normative underpinnings of this enterprise. The Migration of Constitutional Ideas tackles this phenomenon from a diverse range of methodological perspectives. In this introductory essay, I describe and defend a theory of the use of comparative constitutional materials in constitutional interpretation which I term dialogical interpretation. The goal is to use comparative materials as an interpretive foil, to expose the factual and normative assumptions underlying the courtâ€™s own constitutional order. First, comparative materials are engaged to identify the assumptions embedded in positive legal materials. But in the process of articulating the assumptions underlying foreign jurisprudence, a court will inevitably uncover its own. The next move is to engage in a process of justification. If the assumptions are different, the question becomes why they are different. Comparative engagement highlights the contingency of legal and constitutional order, and opens for discussion and contestation those characteristics which had remained invisible to whether those assumptions ought to be shared. Finally, the court is faced with a set of interpretive choices. A court may be able to justify the similarity with, or the difference between, the assumptions underlying its own constitutional order and a foreign one. Comparative engagement, then, leads to a heightened sense of legal awareness through interpretive clarification and confrontation. But the identification and attempted justification of constitutional assumptions through comparison may lead a court to challenge and reject those assumptions and search for new ones. In cases of constitutional similarity, a court may determine a difference to be unfounded, and may rely on comparative jurisprudence as the engine of legal change.

	",31.0,"A number of studies have pointed to various mistakes that consumers might make in their consumption-saving and financial decisions. We utilize a unique market experiment conducted by a large U.S. bank to assess how systematic and costly such mistakes are in practice. The bank offered consumers a choice between two credit card contracts, one with an annual fee but a lower interest rate and one with no annual fee but a higher interest rate. To minimize their total interest costs net of the fee, consumers expecting to borrow a sufficiently large amount should choose the contract with the fee, and vice-versa.    
We find that on average consumers chose the contract that ex post minimized their net costs. A substantial fraction of consumers (about 40%) still chose the ex post sub-optimal contract, with some incurring hundreds of dollars of avoidable interest costs. Nonetheless, the probability of choosing the sub-optimal contract declines with the dollar magnitude of the potential error, and consumers with larger errors were more likely to subsequently switch to the optimal contract. Thus most of the errors appear not to have been very costly, with the exception that a small minority of consumers persists in holding substantially sub-optimal contracts without switching.

	",70.0,"Investors face a number of challenges when seeking to estimate the prospective performance of a long-only investment in commodity futures. For instance, historically, the average annualized excess return of individual commodity futures has been approximately zero and commodity futures returns have been largely uncorrelated with one another. However, the prospective annualized excess return of a rebalanced portfolio of commodity futures can be equity-like. Certain security characteristics, such as the term structure of futures prices, and some portfolio strategies have historically been rewarded with above average returns. Avoiding naÃ¯ve extrapolation of historical returns and striking a balance between dependable sources of return and possible sources of return is important.

	",,"Private equity fund managers take a share of the profits of the partnership as the equity portion of their compensation.  The tax rules for compensating service partners create a planning opportunity for managers who receive the industry-standard ""two and twenty"" (a two percent management fee and twenty percent profits interest).  By taking a portion of their pay in the form of partnership profits, fund managers defer income derived from their labor efforts and convert it from ordinary income into long-term capital gain.  This quirk in the tax law allows some of the richest workers in the country to pay tax on their labor income at a low rate.  Changes in the investment world - the growth of private equity funds, the adoption of portable alpha strategies by institutional investors, and aggressive tax planning - suggest that reconsideration of the partnership profits puzzle is overdue.  In this Article, I offer a menu of reform alternatives, including a novel cost-of-capital approach that would strike an appropriate balance between treating returns on human capital as ordinary income and rewarding entrepreneurial activity with a tax subsidy.    
While there is ample room for disagreement about the scope and mechanics of the reform alternatives, this Article establishes that the status quo is an untenable position as a matter of tax policy.  Among the various alternatives, perhaps the best starting point is a baseline rule that would treat carried interest distributions as ordinary income.  Alternatively, Congress could adopt a more complex ""cost of capital"" approach that would convert a portion of carried interest into ordinary income on an annual basis, or it could allow fund managers to elect into either the ordinary income or ""cost of capital"" approach.  Any of these alternatives to the status quo would tax carried interest distributions to fund managers in a manner that more closely matches how our tax system treats other forms of compensation, thereby improving economic efficiency and discouraging wasteful regulatory gamesmanship.  These changes would also reconcile private equity compensation with our progressive tax rate system and widely-held principles of distributive justice.

The results show a narrowing of the uncorrected gender pay gap from the mid-1990s. Women top executives earn between 8% to 25% less than male executives after controlling for differences in company size, occupational title, and industry. The magnitude of the gender pay gap is statistically related to the gender of the Chief Executive and Corporate Board Chair. Women CEO and Board Chairs bring more top women and at higher pay than is found in non-women-led firms. Specifically, female executives in women-led firms earn between 10-20% more than comparable executive women in male-led firms and are between 3-18% more likely to be among the highest five paid executives in these firms as well. The paper thereby provides strong empirical evidence that women leaders are associated with positive outcomes for women executives in substantive and important ways.

	",20.0,"Abortion may prevent the birth of ""unwanted"" children, who would have relatively small investments in human capital and a higher probability of crime. On the other hand, some research suggests that legalizing abortion increases out-of-wedlock births and single parent families, which implies the opposite impact on investments in human capital and thus crime. The question is: what is the net impact? We find evidence that legalizing abortion increased murder rates by around about 0.5 to 7 percent. Previous estimates are shown to suffer from not directly linking the cohorts who are committing crime with whether they had been born before or after abortion was legal.

This research demonstrates that while overall men tend to recover greater total damages, juries consistently award women more in noneconomic loss damages than men, and that the noneconomic portion of women's total damage awards is significantly greater than the percentage of men's tort recoveries attributable to noneconomic damages. Consequently, any cap on noneconomic loss damages will deprive women of a much greater proportion and amount of a jury award than men.

	",30.0,"Patents represent a quid pro quo between the public and the inventor: in exchange for disclosing the invention, the inventor receives the right to exclude others from practicing her invention.  They therefore serve as a source technical information. Patents also communicate information to markets and companies that serve to reduce various transaction costs, allowing more efficient transactions and investment.  Patents consequently communicate various types of information beyond the technical.    
There is no reason, however, that such messages must be limited to the technical or the pecuniary.  This Article explores whether patents, like other governmental acts such as legislation, can create expressive harms.  The grant of a patent could communicate a message of inferiority to groups whose identity is tied to their biology.  The Article analyzes this potential through the paradigm of granting patents on a gay gene or other biological process that predisposes a person towards a homosexual orientation.  Other conditions implicated by my thesis are the deaf, dwarfs, and high-functioning autistics.  These groups do not regard themselves as pathological or in need of curing, yet genetic discoveries offer the potential for their elimination through what is effectively privatized eugenics.  The grant of a patent on such technologies affords the government's imprimatur of such controversial technologies.

	",9.0,"In 1986, the Supreme Court held that it would entertain claims that a legislative decision to redistrict legislative seats to give unfair advantage to one major political party over the other could violate the United States Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. But the Court's fractured decision in Davis v. Bandemer that such ""partisan gerrymandering"" claims were justiciable resulted in virtually no successful claims in the lower courts.  
In Vieth v. Jubelirer, 124 S. Ct. 1769 (2004), the Court revisited the issue. The case was a 4-1-4 split. Four Justices signed a plurality opinion stating the view that partisan gerrymandering claims should be considered nonjusticiable because of the absence of a ""judicially manageable"" standard for separating permissible from impermissible consideration of party affiliation of voters in the redistricting enterprise. Four Justices would have adopted one of three invigorated tests to police partisan gerrymandering. Justice Kennedy, writing only for himself, agreed with the four dissenters that partisan gerrymandering cases remain justiciable. But he also agreed with the four Justices in the plurality that the Vieth plaintiffs' claim must fail because no one has articulated thus far judicially manageable standards for partisan gerrymandering claims. He suggested a standard might emerge from historical discussions of districting practices, better computer technology, or shifting to a First Amendment analysis.  
Part I of this Article surveys the five opinions in Vieth, focusing on Justice Kennedy's pivotal opinion. Part II explains why Justice Kennedy is unlikely to find a judicially manageable standard for partisan gerrymandering in history, technology, or the First Amendment, given his rejection of vote dilution, expressive harm, conflict of interest, and improper motive tests proposed by the Vieth plaintiffs and dissenters.  Finally, Part III endorses Justice Kennedy's decision to leave the door open to future partisan gerrymandering cases. It explains that the judicial manageability debate in Vieth conflates two separate concerns: one about consistency of result across the courts and a second about the justifiability of a standard for judging partisan gerrymandering claims.  The consistency of result concern is overblown, because the Court could rather easily come up with an easily administrable partisan gerrymandering standard. But the Court should refrain from coming up with such a standard until it could be justified by an emerging social consensus regarding proper and improper consideration of voter party identification in redistricting. If consensus emerges, the Court may embrace it. Until then, the matter should be left to the political processes, which have a number of tools to control egregious partisan behavior.

	",33.0,"We propose a simple method to help researchers develop quantitative models of economic fluctuations. The method rests on the insight that many models are equivalent to a prototype growth model with time-varying wedges which resemble productivity, labor and investment taxes, and government consumption. Wedges corresponding to these variables -- effciency, labor, investment, and government consumption wedges -- are measured and then fed back into the model in order to assess the fraction of various fluctuations they account for. Applying this method to U.S. data for the Great Depression and the 1982 recession reveals that the effciency and labor wedges together account for essentially all of the fluctuations; the investment wedge plays a decidedly tertiary role, and the government consumption wedge, none. Analyses of the entire postwar period and alternative model specifications support these results. Models with frictions manifested primarily as investment wedges are thus not promising for the study of business cycles.

	",45.0,"After documenting the long decline in private sector unionism over the last 50 years, we examine data on NLRB representation elections to determine if changes in the administration of the NLRA during the 1980s reduced the level of organizing activity and success.  While organizing activity sharply declined in 1981 (just before President Reagan's showdown with the air traffic controllers' union, PATCO), we find little evidence that the changes in the administration of the NLRA later in the decade adversely affected the level of union organizing activity.  We then present an accounting framework that decomposes the sharp decline in the private-sector union membership rate into components due to 1) differential growth rates in employment between the union and nonunion sectors, and 2) changes in the union new organization rate (through NLRB-supervised representation elections).  We find that most of the decline in the union membership rate is due to differential employment growth rates and that changes in union organizing activity had relatively little effect.  Given that the differential employment growth rates are due largely to broader market and regulatory forces, we conclude that the prospects are dim for a reversal of the downward spiral of labor unions based on increased organizing activity.

	",30.0,"Considerable attention has recently been given to general equilibrium models of the pricing of capital assets. Of these, perhaps the best known is the mean-variance formulation originally developed by Sharpe (1964) and Treynor (1961), and extended and clarified by Lintner (1965a; 1965b), Mossin (1966), Fama (1968a; 1968b), and Long (1972). In addition Treynor (1965), Sharpe (1966), and Jensen (1968; 1969) have developed portfolio evaluation models which are either based on this asset pricing model or bear a close relation to it. In the development of the asset pricing model it is assumed that (1) all investors are single period risk-averse utility of terminal wealth maximizers and can choose among portfolios solely on the basis of mean and variance, (2) there are no taxes or transactions costs, (3) all investors have homogeneous views regarding the parameters of the joint probability distribution of all security returns, and (4) all investors can borrow and lend at a given riskless rate of interest. The main result of the model is a statement of the relation between the expected risk premiums on individual assets and their ""systematic risk.""  Our main purpose is to present some additional tests of this asset pricing model which avoid some of the problems of earlier studies and which, we believe, provide additional insights into the nature of the structure of security returns.    
The evidence presented in Section II indicates the expected excess return on an asset is not strictly proportional to its B, and we believe that this evidence, coupled with that given in Section IV, is sufficiently strong to warrant rejection of the traditional form of the model given by (1). We then show in Section III how the cross-sectional tests are subject to measurement error bias, provide a solution to this problem through grouping procedures, and show how cross-sectional methods are relevant to testing the expanded two-factor form of the model. We show in Section IV that the mean of the beta factor has had a positive trend over the period 1931-65 and was on the order of 1.0 to 1.3% per month in the two sample intervals we examined in the period 1948-65. This seems to have been significantly different from the average risk-free rate and indeed is roughly the same size as the average market return of 1.3 and 1.2% per month over the two sample intervals in this period. This evidence seems to be sufficiently strong enough to warrant rejection of the traditional form of the model given by (1). In addition, the standard deviation of the beta factor over these two sample intervals was 2.0 and 2.2% per month, as compared with the standard deviation of the market factor of 3.6 and 3.8% per month. Thus the beta factor seems to be an important determinant of security returns.

	",24.0,"Most discussions of modern war powers under the U.S. Constitution assume that wars are no longer formally ""declared.""  The United States, it is agreed, has declared war only five times in its history, the last being in World War II.  But the commentary is deeply divided over how this observation affects the President's power to initiate the use of armed force and the President's powers during wartime.    
This article argues that these debates are fundamentally misconceived.  Far from being a historical anachronism, declarations of war, in the constitutional sense, are commonplace in modern practice.  The U.S. has made such a declaration in essentially all of its major modern conflicts.  They have been made, however, not by the Congress, but by the President.  Perhaps out of a sense of constitutional unease, we avoid actually calling them ""declarations of war.""  But, as the article shows, the essence of a formal declaration of war has long been simply the public announcement of sustained military hostilities and a statement of the conflict's goals and reasons.    
This conclusion simplifies the modern debate over war power in three ways.  First, the central question is whether the President can declare war (not whether the President can fight an ""undeclared"" war).  Second, when Congress authorizes the President to use force, that can be understood constitutionally as delegating Congress' power to declare war to the President.  Finally, debate over the President's wartime powers need not be further complicated by the objection that a ""war"" has not been ""declared.""

This article argues that the law does in fact provide some redress for unconscious discrimination.  Title VII may not be a perfect method for attacking unconscious bias, but it is a mistake to assume that it is without potential.  The article challenges the assumption commonly held by judges that a finding of discrimination must be preceded by the belief that an employer is lying about its reasons for a particular decision.  The Supreme Court's recent decision in Desert Palace v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90 (2004) eliminates any argument that employer mendacity is a prerequisite for plaintiff success under Title VII.  By recognizing that an employer may honestly believe the reasons it offers for a decision, but may nonetheless have been motivated by racial or gender bias in making the decision, the law opens up significant potential for challenging instances of unconscious discrimination.  Further, the article demonstrates that plaintiffs can - and do - challenge unconscious bias both in individual claims and in class litigation through arguments that an employer's decisionmaking processes are excessively subjective.

	",,"Legal scholars have largely neglected private policing, and the neglect is increasingly indefensible. The private security industry already employs more guards, patrol personnel and detectives than the federal, state and local governments combined, and the disparity is growing; to a striking extent, private firms now perform many of the beat-patrol tasks once thought central to the mission of the public police. This article describes what is known and unknown about the private security industry, traces the industry's history, assesses the challenges and opportunities it creates for judges and scholars, and provides an agenda for future research and doctrinal development. Private security firms furnish tangible evidence about what some people want but are not receiving from public law enforcement, and the legal regime governing private security -- deconstitutionalized, defederalized, tort-based, and heavily reliant both on legislatures and on juries -- offers important opportunities to test some of the most persistent proposals for reforming criminal procedure law. In addition, because maintaining order and controlling crime seem paradigmatic governmental functions, private policing presents a unique and underused vantage point for reexamining the public-private distinction and the state action doctrine. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, police privatization provides occasion for reconsidering the focus of constitutional law on negative obligations of government, and the focus of constitutional criminal procedure on fairness to individual criminal defendants; the dramatic spread of policing-for-hire should prompt us to rethink what it means to guarantee all citizens, regardless of wealth, the equal protection of the laws.

	",11.0,"This paper argues that a large component of success in entrepreneurship and venture capital can be attributed to skill. We show that entrepreneurs with a track record of success are more likely to succeed than first time entrepreneurs and those who have previously failed. Funding by more experienced venture capital firms enhances the chance of success, but only for entrepreneurs without a successful track record. Similarly, more experienced venture capitalists are able to identify and invest in first time entrepreneurs who are more likely to become serial entrepreneurs. Investments by venture capitalists in successful serial entrepreneurs generate higher returns for their venture capital investors. This finding provides further support for the role of skill in both entrepreneurship and venture capital.

In this article, Professor Lemley challenges that conventional wisdom. Using available data regarding the cost and incidence of patent prosecution, litigation, licensing and other uses of patents, he demonstrates that strengthening the examination process is not cost effective. The core insight is that very few patents are actually litigated or licensed; most simply sit on a shelf unused, or are used only for noncontroversial purposes like financing. Because of this, society would be better off spending its resources in a more searching judicial inquiry into validity in those few cases in which it matters than paying for a more protracted examination of all patents ex ante. In economic terms, the patent office is ""rationally ignorant"" of the objective validity of the patents it issues.

	",31.0,"A number of studies have pointed to various mistakes that consumers might make in their consumption-saving and financial decisions. We utilize a unique market experiment conducted by a large U.S. bank to assess how systematic and costly such mistakes are in practice. The bank offered consumers a choice between two credit card contracts, one with an annual fee but a lower interest rate and one with no annual fee but a higher interest rate. To minimize their total interest costs net of the fee, consumers expecting to borrow a sufficiently large amount should choose the contract with the fee, and vice-versa.   
     We find that on average consumers chose the contract that ex post minimized their net costs. A substantial fraction of consumers (about 40%) still chose the ex post sub-optimal contract, with some incurring hundreds of dollars of avoidable interest costs. Nonetheless, the probability of choosing the sub-optimal contract declines with the dollar magnitude of the potential error, and consumers with larger errors were more likely to subsequently switch to the optimal contract. Thus most of the errors appear not to have been very costly, with the exception that a small minority of consumers persists in holding substantially sub-optimal contracts without switching.

	",141.0,"Around the world, courts in the last two decades have increasingly extended constitutional law to oversee the basic structure of democracy itself.  This development constitutes a significant transformation in the object of constitutional law - a shift from the conventional individual rights and anti-discrimination focus and toward judicial engagement with the institutions and processes of democratic politics.  Whether resolving disputed Presidential elections, evaluating the design of representative institutions, determining the role of political parties, assessing the financing of elections, or even managing the transition from authoritarian to democratic regimes, courts and constitutional law have now become central actors in organizing the way democracy is practiced.    
The first aim of this Foreword is to make this transformation fully visible.  The Foreword focuses primarily on the United States Supreme Court, where these developments are most pronounced.  The Foreword then turns to assessing this new frontier of constitutional law; the Foreword argues that, thus far, courts have done both too little and too much in the way they have constitutionalized the essential structures of democracy.  Courts have been insufficiently responsive to the tendency of those holding political power to structure the ground rules of democracy to entrench themselves more deeply in power.  At the same time, courts have inappropriately constitutionalized, without sufficient justification, the broad rights of politics - to vote, to speak, to associate - in ways that wrongly limit the ability of democracies to experiment with new ways of organizing democratic politics.  Given the disaffection with current forms of democracy expressed in many mature democracies today, this judicial tendency to constitutionalize existing democratic arrangements and freeze them in place threatens the ability of democracies to revise themselves.  As courts enter this new domain, the Foreword offers a theoretical and doctrinal framework that defines the role constitutional law ought to play - more expansive in some contexts, less expansive in others - in overseeing the structure of democracy.  The Foreword then applies this framework to a number of specific issues: partisan gerrymandering; the representation of diverse groups in political bodies; the legal regulation of political parties; the role of independent bodies to oversee election practices; and campaign financing.

The rapidly changing circumstances in which they operate take on lives of their own, which are difficult or impossible to anticipate or predict.  The only way to meet the continuously unpredictable challenges ahead of us is to match them with continuously unpredictable changes of our own.  We must transform the Intelligence Community into a community that dynamically reinvents itself by continuously learning and adapting as the national security environment changes.    
Recent theoretical developments in the philosophy of science that matured in the 1990's, collectively known as Complexity Theory, suggest changes the community should make to meet this challenge.  These changes include allowing our officers more autonomy in the context of improved tradecraft and information sharing.  In addition, several new technologies will facilitate this transformation.  Two examples are self-organizing knowledge websites, known as Wikis, and information sharing websites known as Blogs.  Allowing Intelligence Officers and our non-intelligence National Security colleagues access to these technologies on SIPRNet, will provide a critical mass to begin the transformation.

	",18.0,"This article considers welfare reform's impact in rural America. Professor Pruitt asserts that federal welfare reform legislation, the Personal Responsibility Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), reflects an urban political agenda that failed to consider rural realities.   Based on her analysis of two particular populations - those living in persistent poverty and those in female-headed households - she concludes that PRWORA has exacerbated rural poverty.     
While PRWORA's focus was on work and time limits on assistance, it gave individual states latitude to design and implement programs tailored to their economic and demographic circumstances.  Pruitt illustrates how some states with significant rural populations used this latitude to institute programs that respond to the structural barriers endemic to rural locales:  greater transportation challenges in light of spatial isolation from jobs, services, and training opportunities; limited child care choices; and deficits in human capital.  But she also points out how states' responses to these challenges have been piecemeal, and their ameliorative impact limited, in the absence of rural economic development.  Pruitt analyzes the contradiction between the decline in the number of rural families receiving welfare (a rate commensurate with that of urban families in the PRWORA era), and the rise in rural poverty since 2002.      
Building on evidence that PRWORA has aggravated the hardships of the rural poor, the article closes by theorizing our national failure to address rural poverty.  Pruitt asserts that the failure is due in part to rural myths and stereotypes, including the significance of the informal economy as a safety net for the rural poor.  She also discusses the difficulty in seeing the problem of rural poverty because of a tendency for urban residents to romanticize even hardship in the context of the rural idyll they imagine.  Pruitt argues that rural myths must be revealed as such, and the limitations and downsides of rural interpersonal familiarity and community must be fully understood, before law and policy makers will address rural poverty in a meaningful way.

	",60.0,"Bayesian consumers infer that hidden add-on prices (e.g. the cost of ink for a printer) are likely to be high prices. If consumers are Bayesian, firms will not shroud information in equilibrium.  However, shrouding may occur in an economy with some myopic (or unaware) consumers.  Such shrouding creates an inefficiency, which firms may have an incentive to eliminate by educating their competitors' customers. However, if add-ons have close substitutes, a ""curse of debiasing"" arises, and firms will not be able to profitably debias consumers by unshrouding add-ons. In equilibrium, two kinds of exploitation coexist. Optimizing firms exploit myopic consumers through marketing schemes that shroud high-priced add-ons. In turn, sophisticated consumers exploit these marketing schemes. It is not possible to profitably drive away the business of sophisticates. It is also not possible to profitably lure either myopes or sophisticates to non-exploitative firms. We show that informational shrouding flourishes even in highly competitive markets, even in markets with costless advertising, and even when the shrouding generates allocational inefficiencies.

	",58.0,"This paper investigates the role of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in the seasonal time-variation of stock market returns. SAD is an extensively documented medical condition whereby the shortness of the days in fall and winter leads to depression for many people. Experimental research in psychology and economics indicates that depression, in turn, causes heightened risk aversion. Building on these links between the length of day, depression, and risk aversion, we provide international evidence that stock market returns vary seasonally with the length of the day, a result we call the SAD effect. Using data from numerous stock exchanges and controlling for well-known market seasonals as well as other environmental factors, stock returns are shown to be significantly related to the amount of daylight through the fall and winter.

In particular, we investigate (i) the level of internet stock prices given their underlying fundamentals, (ii) responses of stock prices to information-based events, (iii) internet-related anomalies, and (iv) the volatility of internet prices. As a potential explanation, we appeal to a model of heterogenous agents with varying degrees of beliefs about asset payoffs who are subject to short sales constraints. In this  framework, it is possible that ""optimistic"" investors overwhelm ""pessimistic"" ones, leading to prices not reflecting fundamental values.

	",,"Issues regarding race and racial identity as well as questions pertaining to property rights and ownership have been prominent in much public discourse in the United States. In this article, Professor Harris contributes to this discussion by positing that racial identity and property are deeply interrelated concepts. Professor Harris examines how whiteness, initially constructed as a form of racial identity, evolved into a form of property, historically and presently acknowledged and protected in American law. Professor Harris traces the origins of whiteness as property in the parallel systems of domination of Black and Native American peoples out of which were created racially contingent forms of property and property rights. Following the period of slavery and conquest, whiteness became the basis of racialized privilege - a type of status in which white racial identity provided the basis for allocating societal benefits both private and public in character. These arrangements were ratified and legitimated in law as a type of status property. Even as legal segregation was overturned, whiteness as property continued to serve as a barrier to effective change as the system of racial classification operated to protect entrenched power.    
Next, Professor Harris examines how the concept of whiteness as property persists in current perceptions of racial identity, in the law's misperception of group identity and in the Court's reasoning and decisions in the arena of affirmative action. Professor Harris concludes by arguing that distortions in affirmative action doctrine can only be addressed by confronting and exposing the property interest in whiteness and by acknowledging the distributive justification and function of affirmative action as central to that task.

We use past female labor force participation and total fertility rates from the country of ancestry as our cultural proxies. These variables should capture, in addition to past economic and institutional conditions, the beliefs commonly held about the role of women in society, i.e., culture. Given the different time and place, only the beliefs embodied in the cultural proxies should be potentially relevant to women's behavior in the US in 1970. We show that these cultural proxies have positive and significant explanatory power for individual work and fertility outcomes, even after controlling for possible indirect effects of culture (e.g., education and spousal characteristics). We examine alternative hypotheses for these positive correlations and show that neither unobserved human capital nor networks are likely to be responsible. We also show that the effect of these cultural proxies is amplified the greater is the tendency for ethnic groups to cluster in the same neighborhoods.

	",95.0,"Copyfraud is everywhere. False copyright notices appear on modern reprints of Shakespeare's plays, Beethoven's piano scores, greeting card versions of Monet's Water Lilies, and even the U.S. Constitution. Archives claim blanket copyright in everything in their collections. Vendors of microfilmed versions of historical newspapers assert copyright ownership. These false copyright claims, which are often accompanied by threatened litigation for reproducing a work without the owner's permission, result in users seeking licenses and paying fees to reproduce works that are free for everyone to use.     
Copyright law itself creates strong incentives for copyfraud. The Copyright Act provides for no civil penalty for falsely claiming ownership of public domain materials. There is also no remedy under the Act for individuals who wrongly refrain from legal copying or who make payment for permission to copy something they are in fact entitled to use for free. While falsely claiming copyright is technically a criminal offense under the Act, prosecutions are extremely rare. These circumstances have produced fraud on an untold scale, with millions of works in the public domain deemed copyrighted, and countless dollars paid out every year in licensing fees to make copies that could be made for free. Copyfraud stifles valid forms of reproduction and undermines free speech.     
Congress should amend the Copyright Act to allow private parties to bring civil causes of action for false copyright claims. Courts should extend the availability of the copyright misuse defense to prevent copyright owners from enforcing an otherwise valid copyright if they have engaged in past copyfraud. In addition, Congress should further protect the public domain by creating a national registry listing public domain works and a symbol to designate those works. Failing a congressional response, there may exist remedies under state law and through the efforts of private parties to achieve these ends.

There are four different European social models, each with its own performance in terms of efficiency and equity.

	",3.0,"Over the past few decades, many paradigm shifts have changed our view of the interrelationship of science and law. Future developments promise that wireless devices will continue to become simultaneously less expensive and more powerful. As distributed and mesh theories are being applied to wireless communications, we should endeavor to develop policy proposals that endow users of the new wireless devices with technology-neutral rights and obligations. The Wireless Device Bill of Rights - an initiative advanced by Bran Ferren, Kalle Konsten and others (and which borrows from the principles of Paul Baran's research) - is one early model to address the rights and obligations of spectrum users by delineating simple rules for what users of the wireless spectrum (in an open spectrum environment) can do rather than what they cannot do. In addition to describing the Wireless Device Bill of Rights, this article questions whether Ronald Coase's scholarship on wireless technologies - which was made prior to the widespread use of digital signaling - may be valuable today's all-digital world.

	",12.0,"All states have criminal laws that can be used to punish sexual behaviors that pose some risk of HIV transmission; half have HIV-specific laws criminalizing sexual contact by people with HIV unless they abstain from unsafe sex, or disclose their HIV status and obtain consent from their partners. Whether these laws influence behavior is unknown. Illinois and New York exhibit contrasting legal conditions. Illinois has an HIV-specific law explicitly requiring disclosure by HIV+ persons. New York has no HIV-specific law. This study tests the null hypothesis that differences in law and beliefs about the law do not influence condom use in anal or vaginal sex.    
In this empirical study, 490 people at elevated risk of HIV were interviewed, 248 in Chicago and 242 in New York City. Approximately half in each state were men who have sex with men (""MSM"") and half were injecting drug users (""IDUs""). Respondents were classified as MSM if they reported ever having had sex with a man, and as IDUs if they reported having injected drugs at least twice in the last three months. One-hundred sixty two subjects reported known HIV infection (Chicago 58; New York City 104). Three-hundred twenty-eight reported being HIV negative or not knowing their HIV status. Indicators of the law were 1) residence in the state, and 2) belief that it is a crime for a person with HIV to have sex with another person without disclosing his or her serostatus. Using stepwise logistic regression, we examined independent predictors of unprotected sex, adjusting for factors including age, race/ethnicity, disclosure, biological sex at birth, sexual orientation and number of partners.    
People who lived in a state with a criminal law explicitly regulating sexual behavior of the HIV-infected were little different in their self-reported sexual behavior from people in a state without such a law. People who believed the law required the infected to practice safer sex or disclose their status reported being just as risky in their sexual behavior as those who did not. Our data do not support the proposition that passing a law prohibiting unsafe sex or requiring disclosure of infection influences people's normative beliefs about risky sex. Most people in our study believed that it was wrong to expose others to the virus and right to disclose infection to their sexual partners. These convictions were not influenced by the respondents' beliefs about the law or whether they lived in a state with such a law or not. Because law was not significantly influencing sexual behavior, our results also undermine the claim that such laws drive people with and or at risk of HIV away from health services and interventions.    
We failed to refute the null hypothesis that criminal law has no influence on sexual risk behavior. Criminal law is not a clearly useful intervention for promoting disclosure by HIV+ people to their sex partners. Given concerns about possible negative effects of criminal law, such as stigmatization or reluctance to cooperate with health authorities, our findings suggest caution in deploying criminal law as a behavior change intervention for seropositives.

Is the widespread availability of one of these instruments, firearms, a crucial determinant of the incidence of murder? Or do patterns of murder and/or violent crime reflect basic socio-economic and/or cultural factors to which the mere availability of one particular form of weaponry is irrelevant?    
This article examines a broad range of international data that bear on two distinct but interrelated questions: first, whether widespread firearm access is an important contributing factor in murder and/or suicide, and second, whether the introduction of laws that restrict general access to firearms has been successful in reducing violent crime, homicide or suicide. Our conclusion from the available data is that suicide, murder and violent crime rates are determined by basic social, economic and/or cultural factors with the availability of any particular one of the world's myriad deadly instrument being irrelevant.

	",191.0,"The recent shootings at a Montreal school have reignited the controversy over the firearm registry and has prompted the Conservative government to review its earlier pledge to scrap the registry. This paper is a timely effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the 1995 firearm legislation that created the firearm registry. In 1995, the government assumed that, by controlling the availability of firearms, the registry would reduce total criminal violence, not just gun violence, suicide and domestic abuse. This legislation is fundamentally flawed because it relies upon public health research to justify its moralistic approach to firearms. Public health advocates have exaggerated the danger of citizens owning firearms through pseudoscientific research methods.     
The firearm registry involves licensing firearm owners as well as registering firearms. Even though the registry was created by the 1995 legislation, it was not implemented until 1998. Since the registry, with its dual function of licensing owners and registering long arms, was first implemented, the total homicide rate has actually increased by 9%. Perhaps the most striking change is that gang-related homicides have increased substantially - almost doubling between 1998 and 2005. Despite the drop in firearm-related suicides since the registry began, an increase in suicides involving hanging has nearly cancelled out the drop in firearm suicides. No persuasive link has been found between the firearm registry and any of these changes.     
In conclusion, no convincing empirical evidence can be found that the firearm program has improved public safety. Violent crime and suicide rates remain virtually unchanged despite the nearly unlimited annual budgets during the first seven years of the firearms registry. Notwithstanding an estimated C$ 2 billion cost to date, the firearms registry remains notably incomplete and has an error rate that remains embarrassingly high.

This emphasis comes at the expense of the values of criminal procedure's sibling, substantive criminal law. This article examines Alford and nolo contendere pleas as case studies in how an obsession with these procedural values blinds courts and scholars to substantive values.  Defendants can in effect plead guilty by entering Alford and nolo contendere pleas, even if they protest their innocence or refuse to admit guilt.  These pleas risk not only convicting innocent defendants, but also impeding the reform, education, and condemnation of guilty defendants.  These pleas leave psychological denial mechanisms in place, especially in the case of sex offenders.  And regardless of how defendants respond, these pleas muddy the denunciation of the crime instead of vindicating victims and the community's moral norms (such as honesty and responsibility).  Pleas should be reserved for those who confess.  Trials are morality plays designed to acquit innocent defendants and teach lessons to guilty defendants who will not confess, their victims, and the community.  This approach leads to a rethinking of plea procedures and the roles of lawyers, judges, and trials in our criminal justice system.

We use past female labor force participation and total fertility rates from the country of ancestry as our cultural proxies. These variables should capture, in addition to past economic and institutional conditions, the beliefs commonly held about the role of women in society, i.e. culture. Given the different time and place, only the beliefs embodied in the cultural proxies should be potentially relevant to women's behavior in the US in 1970. We show that these cultural proxies have positive and significant explanatory power for individual work and fertility outcomes, even after controlling for possible indirect effects of culture (e.g., education and spousal characteristics). We examine alternative hypotheses for these positive correlations and show that neither unobserved human capital nor networks are likely to be responsible. We also show that the effect of these cultural proxies is amplified the greater is the tendency for ethnic groups to cluster in the same neighborhoods.

	",8.0,"Alfred Cowles' (1934) test of the Dow Theory apparently provided strong evidence against the ability of Wall Street's most famous chartist to forecast the stock market. In this paper, we review Cowles' evidence and find that it supports the contrary conclusion -- that the Dow Theory, as applied by its major practitioner, William Peter Hamilton over the period 1902 to 1929, yielded positive risk-adjusted returns. A re-analysis of the Hamilton editorials suggests that his timing strategies yield high Sharpe ratios and positive alphas. Neural net modeling to replicate Hamilton's market calls provides interesting insight into the nature and content of the Dow Theory. This allows us to examine the properties of the Dow Theory itself out-of-sample.

About half of the population between ages 80 and 89 either has dementia or a medical diagnosis of ""cognitive impairment without dementia."" We study lifecycle patterns in financial mistakes using a proprietary database that measures ten different types of credit behavior. Financial mistakes include suboptimal use of credit card balance transfer offers, misestimation of the value of one's house, and excess interest rate and fee payments. In a cross-section of prime borrowers, middle-aged adults make fewer financial mistakes than younger and older adults. We conclude that financial mistakes follow a U-shaped pattern, with the cost-minimizing performance occurring around age 53. We analyze regulatory regimes that may help individuals avoid making financial mistakes. Some of these regimes are designed to address the particular challenges faced by older adults, but much of our discussion is relevant for all vulnerable populations. We discuss disclosure, nudges, financial driving licenses, advanced directives, fiduciaries, asset safe harbors, ex-post and ex-ante regulatory oversight.

	",44.0,"This paper reviews the course of fiscal policy and Social Security policy during the 1990s.   The 1990s witnessed two fundamental changes in U.S. fiscal policy: a dramatic improvement in the current and projected budget balance, and a shift to a new political consensus in favor of balancing the budget excluding Social Security rather than the unified budget.  The dramatic improvement in the budget outlook stemmed both from favorable developments in the economic environment and from deliberate policy actions that reduced budget deficits and later did not spend down the surpluses. In contrast, the 1990s did not witness significant changes in Social Security policy, although alternative visions of Social Security reform received tremendous analytic and popular attention.  The 1994-1996 Advisory Council on Social Security presented three reform plans that placed important emphasis on additional prefunding.  Each involved some form of investment in equities   either centrally, through the trust fund, or in a decentralized manner, through individual accounts.  Late in the decade, with the emergence of on-budget surpluses, the possibility of general revenue contributions to the Social Security system came under serious consideration. In the end, President Clinton decided to pursue Social Security reform based on general revenue contributions to the trust fund and centralized investment in equities rather than creating individual accounts, but his proposal was not adopted.

'tired of life'. Legal officials had called on the courts to 'set a principled boundary', excluding such cases from the scope of permissible voluntary euthanasia, but they arguably failed. This failure is explicable, however, since the case seems justifiable by reference to the two major principles in favour of that practice, respect for autonomy and beneficence. Ultimately, it will be argued that those proponents of voluntary euthanasia who are wary of its use in such circumstances may need to draw upon 'practical' objections, in order to erect an otherwise arbitrary perimeter. Furthermore, it will be suggested that the issues raised by the case are not peculiarly Dutch in nature and that, therefore, there are lessons here for other jurisdictions too.

	",,"Many prosecutors, judges and journalists have claimed that watching television shows like CSI have caused jurors to wrongfully acquit guilty defendants when no scientific evidence is presented. This is the first empirical study designed to investigate whether the CSI effect exists. This survey of 1027 persons called for jury duty in a State court looked at jurors' television viewing habits, their expectations that the prosecutor would produce scientific evidence, and whether they would demand scientific evidence as a condition of a guilty verdict.  While the study did find significant expectations and demands for scientific evidence, there was little or no indication of a link between those preconceptions and watching particular television shows. The authors suggest that to the extent that jurors have significant expectations and demands for scientific evidence, it may have more to do with a broader tech effect in our popular culture rather than any particular CSI effect. At the same time, this article contends that any such increased expectations and demands are legitimate and constitutionally based reflections in jurors of changes in our popular culture, and that the criminal justice system must adapt to accommodate jurors' expectations and demands for scientific evidence.

	",,"This Article empirically examines whether the political orientations of U.S. district court judges affect the types of cases filed in their courts.  For example, it tests whether an increase in the percentage of Republican judges on a court causes a decline in the number of product liability and employment discrimination cases filed.  It finds that judgesâ€™ political orientations have major effects on the number of filings of some types of cases.  Thus, the political orientations of federal district judges have important effects on the outcomes of the federal justice system: fewer plaintiffs seek relief in a court if they believe that the judge is less likely to be sympathetic to their case.  This result also helps explain an important study by other researchers that found that a federal district judgeâ€™s political orientation generally does not affect the probability that a case ends in a judgment for the plaintiff or in a settlement.  This Articleâ€™s findings suggest that those results were caused by a selection bias.  Because parties believe that judgesâ€™ political orientations matter, they are likely settling cases on more favorable terms for the plaintiffs if the cases are assigned to Democratic judges rather than to Republican judges.  As a result, although judgesâ€™ political orientations may not affect the percentage of cases that end in a judgment for the plaintiff or a settlement, the orientations likely are affecting which cases settle and the terms of these settlements.

	",,"This working paper aims at improving the comparability of forecast quality measures of in-solvency prediction studies.    
For this purpose, in a first step commonly used accuracy measures for categorial, ordinal and cardinal insolvency predictions are presented. It will be argued, that ordinal measures are the most suitable measures for sample spanning comparisons concerning predictive power of rating models, as they are not affected by sample default rates. A method for transforming cardinal into ordinal accuracy measures is presented, by which comparisons of insolvency prediction results of older and present-day studies are enabled.    
In the second part of the working paper an overview of influencing variables - aside from the quality of the insolvency prediction methods - is given, which affect the accuracy measures presented in the first part of the paper and thus impair sample spanning comparison of empirically obtained forecast quality results. In this context, methods for evaluating information losses that are attributable to the discretization of continuous rating scales or preselection of portfolios are developed. Measure results of various insolvency prognosis studies are envisaged and compared with three benchmarks. First benchmark is the accuracy that can be achieved solely by taking into account legal status and industry classification of corporations. The second benchmark is the univariate prognosis accuracy of single financial ratios. As third benchmark, ALTMAN's Z-score model is examined, a multivariate insolvency prediction model, that is currently used as reference rating model in many empirical studies. It turns out, however, that the Z-score's forecast quality is so discontenting, that its application is not recommendable.

	",26.0,"This article provides a fresh theoretical perspective on the most important development in immigration law today: the convergence of immigration and criminal law. It proposes a unifying theory - membership theory - for why these two areas of law recently have become so connected, and why that convergence is troubling.  Membership theory restricts individual rights and privileges to those who are members of a social contract between the government and the people.    
Membership theory provides decisionmakers with justification for excluding individuals from society, using immigration and criminal law as the means of exclusion. It operates in the intersection between criminal and immigration law to mark an ever-expanding group of outsiders by denying them the privileges that citizens hold, such as the right to vote or to remain in the United States. Membership theory manifests in this new area through certain powers of the sovereign state: the power to punish, and the power to express moral condemnation.    
This use of membership theory places the law on the edge of a crimmigration crisis.  Only the harshest elements of each area of law make their way into the criminalization of immigration law, and the apparatus of the state is used to expel from society those deemed criminally alien. The result is an ever-expanding population of the excluded and alienated.    
The article begins with a dystopia, narrating a future in which criminal and immigration law have completely merged, and membership theory has resulted in extreme divisions in our society between insiders and outsiders - between the included and the alienated. The rest of the article describes the seeds of that future in the past and present. Part II describes the present confluence of immigration and criminal law. Part III sets out the role of membership theory in those areas in excluding noncitizens and ex-offenders from society. It details the role of sovereign power in drawing and enforcing those lines of exclusion. The article concludes by describing the potential consequences of the convergence of these two areas and the use of membership theory to justify decisions to exclude.

	",,"This study analyzes databases of merits decisions from all four levels of the asylum adjudication process: 133,000 decisions by 884 asylum officers over a seven year period; 140,000 decisions of 225 immigration judges over a four-and-a-half year period; 126,000 decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals over six years; and 4215 decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeal during 2004 and 2005. The analysis reveals significant disparities in grant rates, even when different adjudicators in the same office each considered large numbers of applications from nationals of the same country. In many cases, the most important moment in an asylum case is the instant in which a clerk randomly assigns an application to a particular asylum officer or immigration judge.    
Using cross-tabulations based on public biographies, the paper also explores correlations between sociological characteristics of individual immigration judges and their grant rates. The cross tabulations show that the chance of winning asylum was strongly affected by whether or not the applicant had legal representation, by the gender of the immigration judge, and by the immigration judge's work experience prior to appointment.    
In their conclusion, the authors do not recommend enforced quota systems for asylum adjudicators, but they do make recommendations for more comprehensive training, more effective and independent appellate review, and other reforms that would further professionalize the adjudication system.

According to these words of market wisdom, stock market returns should be higher in the November-April period than those in the May-October period. Surprisingly, we find this inherited wisdom to be true in 36 of the 37 developed and emerging markets studied in our sample. The 'Sell in May' effect tends to be particularly strong in European countries and is robust over time. Sample evidence, for instance, shows that in the UK the effect has been noticeable since 1694.

	",36.0,"In a decade of transition, fear of a leviathan state is giving way to increased focus on oligarchs who ""capture the state."" In the capture economy, the policy and legal environment is shaped to the captor firm`s huge advantage, at the expense of the rest of the enterprise sector. This has  major implications for policy.    
The main challenge of the transition has been to redefine how the state interacts with firms, but little attention has been paid to  the flip side of the relationship: how firms influence the state-especially how they exert influence on and collude with public officials to extract advantages. Some firms in transition economies have been able to shape the rules of the game to their own advantage, at considerable social cost, creating what Hellman, Jones, and Kaufmann call a ""capture economy"" in many countries. In the capture economy, public officials and politicians privately sell underprovided public goods and a range of rent-generating advantages ""a la carte"" to individual firms.    
The authors empirically investigate the dynamics of the capture economy on the basis of new firm-level data from the 1999 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), which permits the unbundling of corruption into meaningful and measurable components.    
They contrast state capture (firms shaping and affecting formulation of the rules of the game through private payments to public officials and politicians) with influence (doing the same without recourse to payments) and with administrative corruption (""petty"" forms of bribery in connection with the implementation of laws, rules, and regulations). They develop economywide measures for these phenomena, which are then subject to empirical measurement utilizing the BEEPS data.    
State capture, influence, and administrative corruption are all shown to have distinct causes and consequences. Large incumbent firms with formal ties to the state tend to inherit influence as a legacy of the past and tend to enjoy more secure property and contractual rights and higher growth rates. To compete against these influential incumbents, new entrants turn to state capture as a strategic choice-not as a substitute for innovation but to compensate for weaknesses in the legal and regulatory framework. When the state underprovides the public goods needed for entry and competition, ""captor"" firms purchase directly from the state such private benefits as secure property rights and removal of obstacles to improved performance-but only in a capture economy.    
Consistent with empirical findings in previous research on petty corruption, administrative corruption-unlike both capture and influence-is not associated with specific benefits for the firm.    
The focus of reform should be shifted toward channeling firms' strategies in the direction of more legitimate forms of influence, involving societal ""voice,"" transparency reform, political accountability, and economic competition. Where state capture has distorted reform to create (or preserve) monopolistic structures supported by powerful political interests, the challenge is particularly daunting.

The Agreement wrote down the overall debt by about 50 percent, gave the debtors a much longer period to repay, and tied payments to export surpluses and Germanyâ€™s ability to repay. The Agreement also allowed Germany to postpone some payments until reunification. The Agreement reflected a subtle and responsible understanding of the problems associated with the reparations and debt crises of the 1920s and 1930s, as well as fears about the moral hazard problems that would arise with making any part of the Agreement contingent on events Germany could influence.

Spreads are cyclical, especially during periods of market turmoil. The sum of half-spreads and one-way commissions, multiplied by annual turnover, is an estimate of the annual proportional cost of aggregate equity trading. This cost drives a wedge between aggregate gross equity returns and net equity returns. This wedge can account for only a small part of the observed equity premium, but all else equal the gross equity premium is perhaps 1% lower today than it was early in the 1900's. Finally, I present evidence that the transaction cost measures that also proxy for liquidity - spreads and turnover - predict stock returns one year or more ahead. High spreads predict high stock returns; high turnover predicts low stock returns. These liquidity variables dominate traditional predictor variables, such as the dividend yield.

	",,"This article, prepared for a voting rights symposium to appear in the Howard Law Journal, considers congressional power to ban state felon disenfranchisement laws. Although courts in other countries have held that the practice of denying the right to vote to felons (or ex-felons) violates constitutional guarantees, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the practice usually does not violate the U.S. Constitution. Current controversy in lower federal courts swirls over whether section 2 of the Voting Rights Act may bar certain state felon disenfranchisement laws. This article looks beyond that controversy to the constitutional question: If Congress passed a clear law barring the state practice of disenfranchising felons (or ex-felons), would the Supreme Court uphold such a law as a permissible exercise of Congressional power to enforce the 14th or 15th amendments? The most promising, but still quite uncertain, basis for congressional power is that a felon disenfranchisement ban enforces equal protection guarantees against race discrimination under the 14th amendment and enforces the right to vote free of race discrimination under the 15th amendment. In particular, the federal government could argue that it is intentional past (and potentially present) race discrimination in this country that leads to cycles of poverty in minority communities, and that such poverty makes it more likely that members of these communities will be arrested. In addition, the government could argue that state discrimination in the administration of the criminal justice system makes it more likely that minorities will be convicted of felonies and therefore disenfranchised. The article concludes that in light of the Supreme Court's new federalism jurisprudence it is uncertain whether the Supreme Court would uphold such a law on this basis as a permissible exercise of congressional power, leaving state legislatures as the prime locus for changes to felon disenfranchisement laws.

	",239.0,"At least since 1750 when Baron de Montesquieu declared peace is the natural effect of trade, a number of economists and political scientists espoused the notion that trade among nations leads to peace. Employing resources wisely to produce one commodity rather than employing them inefficiently to produce another is the foundation for comparative advantage. Specialization based on comparative advantage leads to gains  from trade. If political conflict leads to a diminution of trade, then at least a portion of the costs of conflict can be measured by a nation's lost gains from trade. The greater two nations' gain from trade the more costly is bilateral (dyadic) conflict. This notion forms the basis of Baron de Montesquieu's assertion regarding dyadic dispute. This paper develops an analytical framework showing that higher gains from trade between two trading partners (dyads) lowers the level of conflict between them. It describes data necessary to test this hypothesis, and it outlines current developments and extensions taking place in the resulting trade-conflict literature. Crosssectional evidence using various data on political interactions confirms that trading nations cooperate more and fight less. A doubling of trade leads to a 20% diminution of belligerence. This result is robust under various specifications, and it is upheld when adjusting for causality using cross-section and time-series techniques. Further, the impact of trade is  strengthened when bilateral import demand elasticities are incorporated to better measure gains from trade. Because democratic dyads trade more than non-democratic dyads, democracies cooperate with each other relatively more, thereby explaining the democratic peace that democracies rarely fight each other. The paper then goes on to examine further  extensions of the trade-conflict model regarding specific commodity trade, foreign direct investment, tariffs, foreign aid, country contiguity, and multilateral interactions.

	",,"When the World Bank dreams of ""a world free of poverty,"" what should it be dreaming? In measuring global income or consumption expenditure poverty, the World Bank has widely adopted the $1 a day standard as a lower bound. Because this standard is based on poverty lines in the poorest countries, anyone with income or expenditures below this line will truly be poor. But there is no consensus standard for the upper bound of the global poverty line: above what level of income or expenditures is someone truly not poor? This article proposes that the World Bank compute its lower and upper bounds in a methodologically equivalent way, using the poverty lines of the poorest countries for the lower bound and the poverty lines of the richest countries for the upper bound. The resulting upper bound global poverty line would be 10 times higher than the current lower bound and at least 5 times higher than the currently used alternative lower bound of $2 a day. And in tracking progress toward a world free of poverty, the World Bank should compute measures of global poverty using a variety of weights on the depth and intensity of poverty for a range of poverty lines between the global lower and upper bounds. For instance, rather than trying to artificially force the global population of 6.2 billion (a billion is 1,000 million) into just two categories ""poor"" and ""not poor,"" with the new range of poverty lines the estimates would be that 1.3 billion people are ""destitute"" (below $1 a day), another 1.6 billion are in ""extreme poverty"" (above $1 a day but below $2 dollar a day), and another 2.5 billion are in ""global poverty"" (above extreme poverty but below the upper bound poverty line).

	",20.0,"The release to the community of a sexual offender is frequently accompanied by intense coverage in the news media. Too often, the type of coverage these releases receive serves only to force many offenders into hiding or out of one community and into another. Forced to move to another community, the scapegoating process starts all over again. It is well known that secrecy and isolation are critical elements in sexual offending behaviour. Thus, forcing offenders into hiding does nothing to increase community safety or offender accountability and, arguably, increases the risk that new victims will be created. The most problematic releases are those in which sexual offenders arrive in a community with few or no links, and with little access to appropriate treatment and supervisory services. This article outlines a restorative approach to the risk management of high-risk sexual offenders in Canada using professionally-facilitated volunteerism. The Circles of Support and Accountability model grew out of an ad hoc, faith-based response to a situation much like that described above in South-Central Ontario, Canada. The resultant pilot project has since reached its twelfth anniversary and the model has proliferated both nationally and internationally.

	",1.0,"The Business Bankruptcy Project is a five-year empirical study of about 3,200 business cases originally filed in Chapter 7, Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 in 23 judicial districts during 1994. This first report focuses on financial and demographic data, creating a statistical profile of the businesses in bankruptcy. The data reported in this paper include assets, debts, solvency, corporate or individual debtor type, classification of industries, number of employees, and reasons for filing; the data are reported in the aggregate, by chapter of filing, and by district. These data are used to test a number of hypotheses about the operation of the business bankruptcy system. The report also reveals anomalies in the system, such as certain large debtor companies that file no bankruptcy schedules at all.    
The sample is marked by its diversity, which includes a large number of small businesses and a small number of large businesses. Among the business debtors are a surprising number of natural persons in Chapter 11, a procedure designed around a corporate template. Across all three chapters there is substantial overlap of consumer and business debt, with many business debtors reporting a combination of business and personal reasons as triggers for their bankruptcy filings. Financially, the sample as a whole is solvent, with more than 25% of Chapter 11 business debtors claiming balance-sheet solvency. The social impact of bankruptcy is emphasized by its effect on employees. Although many of businesses are small by most measures, extrapolation from the reported data suggest that as many as 2 million employees a year find their employers going into bankruptcy. Real estate companies are prominent in Chapter 11, and more than half of them claim to be solvent.

	",123.0,"More than 100,000 new asbestos claims were filed in 2003, the most ever in one year.  Asbestos litigation thus continues to thrive even though 80-90% of claimants have no illness recognized by medical science, let alone suffer any lung impairment.  To explain how this disconnect between medical science and tort litigation has come about, I cover the following subjects:    
1) medical consequences of exposure to asbestos-containing materials;  2) the phenomenon of the unimpaired claimant;  3) medical evidence with regard to the incidence of asbestosis;  4) the effect on asbestos litigation of the failure of the Manville Trust audit to be approved;  5)  the causes and effects of seemingly orchestrated changes in party and witness testimony with regard to the identification of asbestos-containing products at work sites; and  6) the Baron & Budd ""script memo.""    
The core of the article is an empirical analysis of attorney-sponsored asbestos screenings which account for approximately 90% of claims being generated.  On the basis of that empirical research, I conclude that asbestos litigation today largely consists of former industrial and construction workers:     (1) recruited by an extensive network of entrepreneurial screening companies which are employed by lawyers to ""screen"" hundreds of thousands of potential litigants each year at local union halls, hotel and motel rooms, shopping center parking lots, and other locations throughout the country;  (2) asserting claims of injury though they have no medically cognizable injury and cannot demonstrate any statistically significant increased likelihood of contracting an asbestos-related disease in the future;   (3) in a civil justice system that has been significantly modified to accommodate the interests of these litigants by dispensing with many evidentiary requirements and proof of proximate cause;    (4) mostly in forum-shopped jurisdictions, where judges and juries often appear aligned with the interests of plaintiff lawyers;    (5) often supported by specious medical evidence, including: (a) evidence generated by the entrepreneurial medical screening enterprises and B-readers - specially certified x-ray readers that the enterprises or plaintiff lawyers select, who fail to exercise good faith medical judgment but instead conform their findings and reports to the expectations of the plaintiff lawyers who retained them, and (b) pulmonary function tests which are often administered in knowing violation of standards established by the American Thoracic Society and result in findings of impairment which would not be found if the tests were properly administered; and  (6) who frequently testify according to scripts prepared by their lawyers which include misstatements with regard to: (a) identifications of and relative quantities of asbestos-containing products that they came in contact with at work sites, (b) the information printed on the containers in which the products were sold, and (c) their own physical impairments.     
It is beyond cavil that asbestos litigation thus represents a massive civil justice system failure.  Because of the awesome power of the asbestos plaintiffs' bar, the issues posed by this failure appear impervious to resolution by civil justice reform.  Realistically, the only fora in which the issues of the mass production of bogus medical evidence and scripted client and witness testimony can be addressed is through an investigatory grand jury process.    
A review of the scholarly literature indicates a substantial degree of indifference to the causes of this civil justice system failure.  Many of the published articles on asbestos litigation focus on transactional costs and ways in which the flow of money from defendants to plaintiffs and their lawyers can be expeditiously and efficiently prioritized and routed.  The failure to acknowledge, let along analyze, the overriding reality of specious claiming and meritless claims demonstrates a disconnect between the scholarship and the reality of the litigation that is nearly as wide as the disconnect between rates of disease claiming and actual disease manifestation.  In this article, I set forth some tentative explanations of this phenomenon.

	",,"This essay explores the relationship between Asian American population and applicability of anti-miscegenation laws to that group in the first half of the 20th Century, testing legal scholar Gilbert Thomas Stephenson's theory that racial restrictions would arise whenever non-whites of any race exist in considerable numbers. Several states prohibited Asian-white intermarriage even though the Asian American numbers failed even remotely to approach those of the white population in those states. These anti-miscegenation statutes were unique in the Jim Crow regime in the degree of specificity with which they defined the racial categories subject to the restrictions, using precise terms like Japanese or Mongolians, rather than broad terms like colored. Further, the number of statutes applicable to Asians more than doubled between 1910 and 1950, even though census data shows that the proportion of Asian population was stable or declining in these states, and in any event tiny.      
The proliferation of anti-Asian miscegenation laws raises important questions about the racial landscape of our country during this period. Correlating census data with the development of anti-miscegenation statutes suggests that population does have an impact on whether states would restrict Asian marriage, but in a more complex way than Stephenson proposed. In all states in which Asian-white marriage was restricted by race, so too was African American-white intermarriage; no statutes targeted Asians alone. But in virtually all states restricting African American intermarriage where there was a discernable Asian population - 1/2000th  or more - Asian intermarriage was also regulated. The combination of a state's inclination to segregate, plus a visible Asian population, reliably predicts when Asians would be covered by a statute. This suggests that in the states where racially diverse populations were seen as threats appropriately subject to legal regulation, the nature of the problems presented by the various races was the same.

	",56.0,"We examine the penalties imposed on all 585 firms that were targeted by SEC enforcement actions for financial misrepresentation from 1978 - 2002, which we track through November 15, 2005.  The penalties imposed on firms through the legal system average only $23.5 million per firm.  The penalties imposed by the market, in contrast, are huge.  Our point estimate of the reputational penalty - which we define as the expected loss in the present value of future cash flows due to lower sales and higher contracting and financing costs - is over 7.5 times the sum of all penalties imposed through the legal and regulatory system.  For each dollar that a firm misleadingly inflates its market value, on average, it loses this dollar when its misconduct is revealed, plus an additional $3.08.  Of this additional loss, $0.36 is due to expected legal penalties and $2.71 is due to lost reputation.  In firms that survive the enforcement process, lost reputation is even greater at $3.83.  In the cross-section, the reputational penalty is positively related to measures of the firm's reliance on implicit contracts.  This evidence belies a widespread belief that financial misrepresentation is disciplined lightly.  To the contrary, reputation losses impose substantial penalties for cooking the books.

	",,"Constitutional theorists are in the midst of a debate over the appropriate institutional arrangements for the interpretation and enforcement of constitutional norms in a constitutional democracy. For legal constitutionalists, supreme authority to interpret and enforce the constitution rests with the courts. Popular constitutionalists, by contrast, permit and even require that members of the executive and legislative branches independently interpret the constitution in the course of performing their function. In this chapter, I question the legal constitutionalist belief (expressed by Frederic Schauer) that equates constitutional strategies of precommitment with legal constitutionalism and judicial supremacy. Along with popular constitutionalists, I would argue that it would be a mistake to infer that the boundaries of judicial decision making are coterminous with the limits of the constitution. The choice is not between legal constitutionalism and its populist alternative. Rather, the true choice is when and to what extend to opt for one or the other. Indeed, the challenge may be to design arrangements that permit the responsive and even tentative allocation of institutional responsibility for resolving constitutional questions.

	",32.0,"The precautionary principle calls on decisionmakers to take preventive action in light of evidence indicating that there is a potential for harm to public health and the environment, even though the nature and magnitude of harm are not fully understood scientifically. Critics of the precautionary principle frequently argue that unbridled application of the principle leads to unintended damage to health and ecosystems (risk tradeoffs) and that precautious decision making leaves us vulnerable to ""false-positive"" risks that divert resources away from ""real risks."" The 1991 cholera epidemic in Peru is often cited as an example of these pitfalls of the precautionary principle. It has been mistakenly argued that application of the precautionary principle caused decisionmakers to stop chlorinating the water supply due to the risks of disinfection byproducts (DBPs), resulting in the epidemic. Through analyses of investigations conducted in the cities of Iquitos and Trujillo, Peru, literature review, and interviews with leading Peruvian infectious disease researchers, we determined that the epidemic was caused by a much more complex set of circumstances, including poor sanitation conditions, poor separation of water and waste streams, and inadequate water treatment and distribution systems. The evidence indicates that no decision was made to stop chlorinating on the basis of DBP concerns and that concerns raised about DBPs masked more important factors limiting expansion of chlorination. In fact, outside of Peru's capital Lima, chlorination of drinking water supplies at the time of the epidemic was limited at best. We conclude that the Peruvian cholera epidemic was not caused by a failure of precaution but rather by an inadequate public health infrastructure unable to control a known risk: that of microbial contamination of water supplies.

	",,"One challenge facing hegemonic stability theory is to specify the processes by which hegemonic countries construct and maintain a liberal international economic order. Earlier studies have focused on direct coercion or ideological manipulations by the hegemon as a principal technique for manipulating the trade policies of other countries. This article explores a different face of hegemony. Specifically, we contend that by altering relative prices through the exercise of their international market power, hegemonic leaders influence the trade policy preferences of their foreign trading partners. We examine this argument in the case of the American Walker Tariff of 1846. American tariff liberalization was intimately related to Britain's repeal of its Corn Laws. In the antebellum United States, Northern protectionist and Southern free trade proclivities were fixed; Western grain growers held the balance of power. By allowing access to its lucrative grain market, Britain altered the economic and political incentives of Western agriculturalists and facilitated the emergence of the free trade coalition essential to the passage of the Walker Tariff.

	",16.0,"In discussions of statutory interpretation, people often suggest that textualists and intentionalists have fundamentally different goals:  intentionalists try to identify the subjective intent of the enacting legislature, while textualists care only about the objective meaning of the statutory text. This distinction, however, is far less helpful than the rhetoric on both sides suggests. To begin with, the distinction itself is exaggerated; judges whom we think of as textualists construct their sense of objective meaning from what the evidence that they are willing to consider tells them about the subjective intent of the enacting legislature. Many textualists do impose more restrictions than the typical intentionalist on the evidence of intent that they are willing to consider, but those restrictions need not reflect any fundamental disagreement about the goals of interpretation. In any event, whatever disagreements may exist on this score do not account for the most significant differences between textualism and intentionalism. Thus, even when there is no useful legislative history on some question of interpretation (and hence no intrinsic reason for the objective meaning sought by textualists to diverge from the subjective intent sought by intentionalists), one can still expect to observe systematic differences between the results reached by textualists and the results reached by intentionalists.    
For people seeking to describe how textualism and intentionalism really differ, the familiar distinction between rules and standards is a more productive starting point than the distinction between objective meaning and subjective intent. Within certain constraints, all mainstream interpreters seek the meaning intended by the enacting legislature. As a methodological matter, however, textualists seem to believe that a relatively rule-based approach to interpretation is likely to bring judges closer to that goal than the more holistic techniques favored by intentionalists. As a normative matter, moreover, textualists are more likely than intentionalists to resolve uncertainties in favor of ruleness; when the meaning intended by the enacting legislature is concededly unclear, it is unusual for intentionalists to settle upon a more rule-like interpretation than textualists. Without regard to any purported disagreement about the goals of interpretation, these twin differences are capable of generating most of the divide that we currently observe.

	",41.0,"In this paper, we examine the disincentive effects of the public employment service on the search effort of unemployed workers and on their exit rate from unemployment. For that purpose, we specify a structural search model with fixed and variable costs of search in which unemployed workers select their optimal search intensity given the exogenous arrival rate of job offers coming from the public employment agency. Because the theoretical effect of an increase in this exogenous job offer arrival rate on the structural exit rate from unemployment is ambiguous, we estimate this model using individual unemployment duration data. Our results show that the exit rate from unemployment increases with the arrival rate of job contacts obtained by the public employment service, especially for low-educated and low-skilled workers. They also show that the search effort is more costly for low-educated women and low-skilled adult unemployed workers. This last result suggests that a public employment agency that matches searchers and employers is beneficial, in the sense that it saves searchers in terms of search costs they would otherwise bear.

We hypothesize that genetic programming algorithms can aid in this endeavor. To investigate this proposition, we conducted an experiment using a very large dataset from the 1999 Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) Cup data, supplied by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and MIT's Lincoln Laboratories. Using machine-coded linear genomes and a homologous crossover operator in genetic programming, promising results were achieved in detecting malicious intrusions.

We confirm earlier results in the literature that there is indeed a strong seasonal effect in stock returns in many countries: stock market returns tend to be significantly lower during summer and fall months than during winter and spring months. However, we also show that at best, these two studies offer two of many possible explanations for the observed seasonal effect. As an illustration we link ice cream production and airline travel to the stock market seasonality using similar reasoning.

Reverse mortgages let ""house rich, cash poor"" older homeowners transfer wealth from the wealthy period after their home is sold to the impoverished period before.  Near absence of demand seems to contradict life cycle consumption theory and has been blamed in part on large up-front fees.  These fees, in turn, are justified by  adverse selection and moral hazard concerns related to length of stay in the home.  In fact, reverse mortgage loan histories and the American Housing Survey reveal that single women who are reverse mortgage borrowers depart from their homes at a rate almost 50 percent greater than observably similar non-participating homeowners.  This surprising fact appears to arise from the phenomenon that the types of people who wish to take equity out of their homes through reverse mortgage borrowing are also likely to take out the remaining home equity by selling their homes. This mechanism is similar to the heterogeneity in risk aversion proposed by de Meza and Webb (2001) to rationalize advantageous selection in insurance markets.  Further results suggest that future declines in price appreciation may generate sufficient moral hazard as to undermine the advantageous selection seen to date.

This paper reprints an edited version of Jack Treynor's famous 1962 manuscript. The author's facsimile of the original mimeograph was obtained thanks to the kind generosity of Professor Elroy Dimson of the London Business School. Edits in the present version, which differ from the original Rough Draft, include minor typographical corrections and minor notation differences for some variables in the formulae.  
Specifically, where Mr. Treynor used a bar or curve over a variable, I use an underscore, and I have omitted the upper and lower limits (and their index) above and below all Sigma summation signs as the nature of the summations is clear. Pagination is as in the original.  
I have otherwise attempted, in this replica, to preserve the vintage character of the document, including font style, spacing, margins and a reproduction reminiscent of the days prior to the invention of photocopy machines and modern portfolio theory. Unfortunately, I could not replicate the wonderful mimeo aroma.  
Mr. Treynor points out that many minor changes will be evident to anyone who compares the Craig French version to the version in Robert Korajczyk's book, Asset Pricing and Portfolio Performance, Risk Books, London, 1999 [Chapter 2, pp. 15-22]. Mr. Treynor considers all French's changes improvements.

	",27.0,"This essay focuses on Wal-Mart's role in an important emerging phenomenon:  the development of efficient systems of private law making by non-governmental organizations that sometimes supplement, and sometimes displace traditional legal systems.  These emerging global systems of private law making are spearheaded by an important group of large multinational corporations like Wal-Mart.  It arises in the shadow of, parallel with, and in response to the less successful attempts by national and international bodies to regulate economic behavior on a global scale. These systems are grounded in private law, contractual and business connections between the great multi-national corporations and the many entities with which they have business relationships. This essay concentrates on one aspect of those connections - supplier or supply chain agreements involving multinational corporations.  It examines the way Wal-Mart is able to use those contractual relationships to legislate behavior among its suppliers with respect to product quality, working conditions for the suppliers' employees, ethical conduct, and similar matters.  The particulars of those behaviors reflect Wal-Mart's perception of the tastes and expectations of its consumers, investors and the financial community.  Those tastes and expectations, in turn, are formed by elements of civil society and spread by elements of the media.  Civil society elements serve not only to form consumer tastes, but also to develop Wal-Mart's specific set of behavior norms and then independently monitor compliance by Wal-Mart and its suppliers with their obligations.   The media independently serves as the source of legitimacy and the conduit through which the results of civil society monitoring efforts, and the efforts of Wal-Mart to correct these breaches are transmitted.  The media also serves as a forum through which consumer and investment tastes in behavior are developed.  Together, multinationals, elements of civil society, the media, and the consumer-investor community constitute the elements of an autonomous system for the efficient regulation of economic behavior on a global scale that may contribute to the development of functionally differentiated and partial global systems of common law beyond the state.

Two explanations have received a great deal of attention: the tax-loss selling hypothesis and the gamesmanship hypothesis. This paper documents that seasonality in returns is not a phenomenon observed only for small firms' stock or those with low prices. Strong seasonality in excess returns is reported for a sample of widely followed firms. Sample firms have unusually low excess returns in January, and returns adjust upward over the remainder of the year. These results are consistent with the gamesmanship hypothesis but not the tax-loss-selling hypothesis. As financial institutions rebalance their portfolios in January to sell the stock of highly visible and low-risk firms, there is downward price pressure in January. In addition, the results suggest that firm visibility explains why seasonality in returns is related to firm size and stock price. Once we control for visibility, market value and uncertainty do not appear to be important determinants of seasonality.

	",32.0,"Botswana has had the highest rate of per-capita growth of any country in the world in the last 35 years.  This occurred despite adverse initial conditions, including minimal investment during the colonial period and high inequality.  Botswana achieved this rapid development by following orthodox economic policies.  How Botswana sustained these policies is a puzzle because typically in Africa, ""good economics"" has proved not to be politically feasible.  In this paper we suggest that good policies were chosen in Botswana because good institutions, which we refer to as institutions of private property, were in place.    
Why did institutions of private property arise in Botswana, but not other African nations?  We conjecture that the following factors were important.  First Botswana possessed relatively inclusive pre-colonial institutions, placing constraints on political elites.  Second the effect of British colonialism on Botswana was minimal, and did not destroy these institutions.  Third, following independence, maintaining and strengthening institutions of private property were in the economic interests of the elite.  Fourth, Botswana is very rich in diamonds, which created enough rents that no groups wanted to challenge the status quo at the expenses of ""rocking the boat.""  Finally we emphasize that this situation was reinforced by a number of critical decisions made by the post-independence leaders, particularly Presidents Khama, and Masire.

We test this prediction by partitioning investors on the basis of a variable that provides a natural proxy for overconfidence--gender. Psychological research has established that men are more prone to overconfidence than women. Thus, models of investor overconfidence predict that men will trade more and perform worse than women. Using account data for over 35,000 households from a large discount brokerage firm, we analyze the common stock investments of men and women from February 1991 through January 1997. Consistent with the predictions of the overconfidence models, we document that men trade 45 percent more than women and earn annual risk-adjusted net returns that are 1.4 percent less than those earned by women. These differences are more pronounced between single men and single women; single men trade 67 percent more than single women and earn annual risk-adjusted net returns that are 2.3 percent less than those earned by single women.

	",54.0,"Since the inception of the first permanent American bankruptcy law in 1898, the intellectual and political understanding of consumer bankruptcy has been anchored in a model that views bankruptcies as resulting from household financial distress.  For much of the Twentieth Century, this traditional model provided a plausible explanation of bankruptcy filing patterns and clear normative policy implications.  Moreover, the widespread intellectual and social consensus on the traditional model was reflected in the enactment of the current Bankruptcy Code in 1978, which rests on the intellectual foundation of the traditional model.  To this day, leading bankruptcy scholars adhere to the traditional model and its implications.  Over the past twenty-five years, however, the traditional model has broken down.  During a period of unprecedented prosperity and economic stability, personal bankruptcies have soared, raising fundamental questions about the validity of the traditional model.    
This article argues that there has been an unacknowledged sea-change in the economics of consumer bankruptcy in America.  This article first provides a scientific analysis of the traditional model to determine whether these new trends can be accommodated within the traditional model.  It focuses on the key variables offered by the traditional model as components of household financial distress: first, high levels of household indebtedness, including the influences of credit cards and home mortgages; second, unemployment and downsizing; third, divorce; and fourth, health problems, health care costs, and lack of health insurance.  A scientific analysis of the evidence demonstrates that although these factors can explain part of the background exogenous level of bankruptcies, as well as some regional variation in bankruptcy filing rates, they cannot explain the upward trend in bankruptcy filing rates over the past twenty-five years.  The article then briefly discusses an alternative model of consumer bankruptcy that can explain the increased propensity for consumers to file bankruptcy through an examination of the legal, social, and economic institutions of the consumer bankruptcy system.

The revisionary reading also debunks certain popular myths about Legal Realism, like the following:  the Realists believed ""what the judge ate for breakfast determines the decision""; a critique of the public/private distinction was a central part of Realist jurisprudence; and the Realists were committed to an incoherent form of rule-skepticism.

Prior to the Vietnam War, military attacks that damaged only the non-human environment were an exclusively domestic concern; international law only prohibited environmentally-destructive attacks that directly threatened human survival.  Since Vietnam, the international community has adopted a number of agreements that prohibit causing environmental damage during wartime even if that damage affects only the non-human environment, but those agreements either impose nothing more than State responsibility for violations or leave the decision to criminalize environmentally-destructive attacks to the States themselves - something they have proven exceedingly reluctant to do.    
Article 8(2)(b)(iv), however, remains a work in progress.  As this essay demonstrates, a number of problems substantially limit the Article's ability to punish wartime environmental damage: its actus reus is excessively vague, particularly the requirement that damage be widespread, long-term, and severe; its proportionality standard is heavily weighted against finding an attack disproportionate; its mens rea is purely subjective, making it nearly impossible to find that a perpetrator knew her attack would be disproportionate; and it does not apply to internal armed conflicts.      
Article (8)(2)(b)(iv)'s limitations have led one prominent scholar to question whether the ICC is an appropriate mechanism for addressing environmental war crimes.  We believe that it is.  Although significant revision is necessary, the Article could be re-drafted to provide real protection against the environmental damage that all too often accompanies war.  The purpose of our essay is thus constructive as well as critical - not only to identify the limitations of Article 8(2)(b)(iv), but also to suggest ways in which those limitations could be addressed.

	",12.0,"Health law in the U.S. coalesced intellectually and academically roughly 25 years ago as the doctrinal and public policy study of law that applies to the health care industry. Many scholars, are dissatisfied, however, with the state of the field. What existed for centuries as a field defined by physicians' encounters with courts is now defined in essentially the same fashion, only much more broadly, as the judicial, legislative, market, and regulatory systems' encounter with all facets of the health care industry. The field is much richer and more sophisticated than in its origins, but a hodgepodge it still is. Each of the four major branches stands apart from the others and is thought to be dominated by distinct themes.     
For a body of substantive law to emerge as a distinctive field of intellectual inquiry, it must be more than just the assortment of rules that result from applying other bodies of substantive law to a particular economic sector or human activity. Such a field is not intellectually distinctive unless there are one or more attributes of the economic or social enterprise in question that make it uniquely important or difficult in the legal domain. For medicine, surely this is the case.  Medical law is about the delivery of an extremely important, very expensive, and highly specialized professional service delivered in situations of tremendous personal vulnerability. This is what has attracted scholars to the field. For this simple reason, I propose an essentialist view approach: what are the essential features of health care delivery that distinguish its legal issues from those of other related fields.  
Of course, any applied body of law should take some stock of its particular subject matter. But, this need to contextualize is much more compelling in health care law than in many or most other economic and social arenas.  That is why its defining characteristics include the special features of medicine. Under this essentialist approach, when ethics, or law, regards patients, it tends to regard them as patients, rather than as people who happen to be patients. And the same is true for people who are physicians and for services that are medical care. Sometimes, it matters fundamentally, even profoundly, that a legal matter involves physicians caring for patients rather than providers servicing generic consumers. When this is so, general law becomes health care law.  In sum, the core of academic health care law consists of those aspects of law for which the unique features of medicine are central to the analysis or inquiry, rather than medicine simply being an incident of generic law's subject matter.

	",,"Courts and scholars have increasingly assumed that intellectual property is a form of property, and have applied the economic insights of Harold Demsetz and other property theorists to condemn the use of intellectual property by others as free riding. In this article, I argue that this represents a fundamental misapplication of the economic theory of property. The economics of property is concerned with internalizing negative externalities - harms that one person's use of land does to another's interest to it, as in the familiar tragedy of the commons. But the externalities in intellectual property are positive, not negative, and property theory offers little or no justification for internalizing positive externalities. Indeed, doing so is at odds with the logic and functioning of the market. From this core insight, I proceed to explain why free riding is desirable in intellectual property cases except in limited circumstances where curbing it is necessary to encourage creativity. I explain why economic theory demonstrates that too much protection is just as bad as not enough protection, and therefore why intellectual property law must search for balance, not free riders.  Finally, I consider whether we would be better served by another metaphor than the misused notion of intellectual property as a form of tangible property.

Illegal Defense: The Irrational Economics of Banning High School Players from the NBA Draft,87 Pages,Posted: 25 Jul 2004,Michael McCann,"

	",148.0,"Each year, the National Basketball Association (NBA) conducts its annual entry draft (NBA Draft), which is the exclusive process by which premiere amateur players gain entrance into the NBA.  To the dismay of many commentators, a number of drafted players will have just completed their senior year of high school.  Routinely, these players are dismissed as immature, unprepared, and ill-advised, even though most will sign guaranteed, multi-million dollar contracts before their college educations would have begun.      
In stark contrast to popular myth, this Article finds that players drafted straight out of high school are not only likely to do well in the NBA, but are likely to become better players than any other age group entering the league.  In fact, on average, these players perform better in every major statistical category than does the average NBA player or the average NBA player of any age cohort.  Beyond excellence in performance, high school players can also earn substantially more over the course of their NBA careers, largely due to the brief, but steep career earnings-curve of professional basketball players, as well as collectively-bargained labor conditions concerning free agency.  Strikingly, players who bypass college may earn as much as $100 million more over the course of their careers than had they earned a college diploma.      
These results may appear surprising and even unpopular, but they only represent predictable outcomes of the NBA's economic system, which, perhaps unintentionally, provides unambiguous incentives for premiere high school players to seek entrance into the NBA as soon as possible.  In turn, since those players are often the most talented, they tend to develop at a uniquely accelerated rate, and thus their earlier arrival and longer stay ultimately benefits the NBA.  At the same time, those high school players better off attending college tend to do so because of contrasting incentives generated by this same economic system.  In short, high school players have proven to be the best group of players entering the NBA because the NBA's economic system dictates that very outcome.    
Despite the systematically-predictable success of high school players in the NBA, league executives and myriad social commentators desire to ban them.  As a result, this Article explores whether federal labor law and antitrust law might preclude the NBA from imposing such a ban.  Related discussion analyzes the two most likely forms of employment preclusion: a collectively bargained ban or a unilaterally imposed ban    
First, should the NBA and the National Basketball Players' Association (NBPA) agree to a provision banning high school players from the NBA Draft, a court may defer to their collective bargaining, even though high school players would not have had a seat at the negotiating table when such a rule was created.  Although the NBA and the NBPA have flirted with such negotiations in the past, this scenario seems unlikely, in part due to the specter of litigation, and in part due to likely allegations of hypocrisy levied against the NBPA, which, historically, has unequivocally opposed such a rule.  Moreover, pending the final outcome of former Ohio State football player Maurice Clarett's lawsuit against the National Football League (NFL) and its age prohibition, the mere ability of the NBA and NBPA - and any professional sports league and players' association - to construct such a rule would be cast in doubt.    
Even if the NFL defeats Clarett in court, and the NBPA were to accept a ban on high school players during the next collective bargaining negotiation, a group of sympathetic and, more importantly, influential NBPA members could seek to decertify the union.  Decertification would require a majority vote of NBPA members.  Provided a majority of NBPA members agree to decertify, the NBPA would lose its collective bargaining power, thus rendering the ban ineffectual.     
Should the NBA unilaterally impose the ban, however, the analysis turns to antitrust law.  Despite recent judicial trends to apply the flexible rule of reason analysis to group boycotts, courts have remained generally consistent in applying the more stringent per se analysis to boycotts where the boycotting group serves as the only option for potential buyers or sellers.  In the context of the NBA, high school players, like all potential draft picks, are the sellers since they are selling their talents to NBA teams, the buyers.  Because there is no substitute equivalence to the NBA, boycotted players would not be able to secure comparable employment.  In this scenario, therefore, high school players would have an excellent opportunity to characterize the ban as a group boycott.    
A less predictable scenario would occur if a court employs rule of reason analysis or quasi-rule of reason analysis.  In those instances, a judicial balancing of procompetitive and anticompetitive effects would weigh a number of factors, including how a ban fails to provide procedural safeguards, how the NBA dominates global basketball, and how high school players comprise only 4 percent of all NBA players.  Because antitrust law has generally been confined to instances where large segments of buyers or sellers have been boycotted, the dearth of high school players may prove significant.  On the other hand, a blanket prohibition on high school players would fail to provide procedural safeguards, thus potentially animating a court to find it in violation of antitrust law.

	",63.0,"Feminists have often criticized law's ignorance of women's day-to-day, lived experiences, even as they have sought to reveal the variety among those experiences. This article builds on both critiques to argue for greater attentiveness to a neglected aspect of women's situation:  place. Specifically, Professor Pruitt asserts that the hardships and vulnerability that mark the lives of rural women and constrain their moral agency are overlooked or discounted by a contemporary cultural presumption of urbanism.       
This Article considers judicial responses to the realities of rural women's lives in relation to three legal issues:  intimate abuse, termination of parental rights, and abortion. In each of these contexts, Pruitt scrutinizes judicial treatment of spatial isolation, lack of anonymity, a depressed socioeconomic landscape, and other features of rural America. She contrasts responses to the plight of rural women in these legal contexts, where courts often show little empathy or understanding, with judicial responses to the vulnerability and hardships associated with sustaining rural livelihoods in non-gendered contexts.      
Drawing on rural sociology and economics, as well as from judicial opinions, Pruitt argues that the combination of features that constitute rural America seriously disadvantages rural women. She further maintains that this disadvantage is aggravated when society's prevailing urban perspective obscures legal recognition of the rural. Unlike Catharine MacKinnon's landmark work under a similar title, Toward a Feminist Theory of the State, Pruitt does not purport to articulate grand theory. Nevertheless, by showing how features of rural life are often overlooked or misunderstood by legal actors, and by explaining the legal relevance of these features to critical junctures at which women encounter the law, Pruitt begins the process of articulating a feminist theory of the rural.

The process of legal transplantation has long been the subject of a polarized debate in international academic circles and has generated opposing approaches to the transfer of legal regulations or entire systems of law from one country to another. The approach to diffusion herein comprises a synthesis of multiple methodologies of comparative law (and jurisprudence on the whole) supplemented with the routes of non-legal disciplines. Such interdisciplinary approach facilitates an exhaustive insight into legal transplants and their applicability as a concept of legal development.

This phenomenon of risk migration suggests that we should take processes over time, rather than specific risks or specific technologies, as a unit of analysis. Several of our existing models of the social management of risks - such as that of social risk amplification - are process models of a kind but are still oriented around the playing out of a particular event or issue. A case study of risk in a group of flame-retardant compounds was used as the basis of a grounded, exploratory analysis of migration processes, the phenomena that influence them, and their consequences. This illustrated how migration naturally occurs from risks that are understood, in which risk bearers have at least some agency, to risks that are not understood and not capable of being influenced by risk bearers. It illustrated how the simultaneous improvement in measuring technology, which detects potential toxins at increasingly small concentrations, combines with intuitive models that ignore concentration to produce conditions likely to generate anxiety. And it illustrated how pressure groups and commercial interests exploit this effect. It also showed how migration makes precautionary action problematic, and how more generally it tends to undermine a society's capacity to cope with risk.

	",,"During the 1980s, a number of unusual financial crises occurred.  In Chile, for example, the financial sector collapsed, leaving the government with responsibility for extensive foreign debts.  In the United States, large numbers of government-insured savings and loans became insolvent - and the government picked up the tab.  In Dallas, Texas, real estate prices and construction continued to boom even after vacancies had skyrocketed, and the suffered a dramatic collapse.  Also in the United States, the junk bond market, which fueled the takeover wave, had a similar boom and bust.    
In this paper, we use simple theory and direct evidence to highlight a common thread that runs through these four episodes.  The theory suggests that this common thread may be relevant to other cases in which countries took on excessive foreign debt, governments had to bail out insolvent financial institutions, real estate prices increased dramatically and then fell, or new financial markets experienced a boom and bust.  We describe the evidence, however, only for the cases of financial crisis in Chile, the thrift crisis in the United States, Dallas real estate and thrifts, and junk bonds.    
Our theoretical analysis shows that an economic underground can come to life if firms have an incentive to go broke for profit at society's expense (to loot) instead of to go for broke (to gamble on success).  Bankruptcy for profit will occur if poor accounting, lax regulation, or low penalties for abuse give owners an incentive to pay themselves more than their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations.

	",12.0,"We study the determinants and consequences of cross-listings on the New York and London stock exchanges from 1990 to 2005. This investigation enables us to evaluate the relative benefits of New York and London exchange listings and to assess whether these relative benefits have changed over time, perhaps as a result of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of Congress (SOX) in 2002. We find that cross-listings have been falling on U.S. exchanges as well as on the Main Market in London. This decline in cross-listings is explained by changes in firm characteristics rather than by changes in the benefits of cross-listing. We show that, after controlling for firm characteristics, there is no deficit in cross-listing counts on U.S. exchanges related to SOX. Investigating the valuation differential between listed and nonlisted firms (the ""cross-listing premium"") from 1990 to 2005, we find that there is a significant premium for U.S. exchange listings every year, that the premium has not fallen significantly in recent years, that it persists when allowing for unobservable firm characteristics, and that there is a permanent premium in event time. In contrast, there is no premium for listings on London's Main Market for any year. Crosslisting in the U.S. leads firms to increase their capital-raising activity at home and abroad while a London listing has no such impact. Our evidence is consistent with the theory that an exchange listing in New York has unique governance benefits for foreign firms. These benefits have not been seriously eroded by SOX and cannot be replicated through a London listing.

	",54.0,"In an analysis of the French episode of heat wave in 2003, this article highlights how heat wave dangers result from the intricate association of natural and social factors. Unusually high temperatures, as well as socioeconomic vulnerability, along with social attenuation of hazards, in a general context where the anthropogenic contribution to climate change is becoming more plausible, led to an excess of 14,947 deaths in France, between August 4 and 18, 2003. The greatest increase in mortality was due to causes directly attributable to heat: dehydration, hyperthermia, heat stroke. In addition to age and gender, combinatorial factors included preexisting disease, medication, urban residence, isolation, poverty, and, probably, air pollution. Although diversely impacted or reported, many parts of Europe suffered human and other losses, such as farming and forestry through drought and fires. Summer 2003 was the hottest in Europe since 1500, very likely due in part to anthropogenic climate change. The French experience confirms research establishing that heat waves are a major mortal risk, number one among so-called natural hazards in postindustrial societies. Yet France had no policy in place, as if dangerous climate were restricted to a distant or uncertain future of climate change, or to preindustrial countries. We analyze the heat wave's profile as a strongly attenuated risk in the French context, as well as the causes and the effects of its sudden shift into amplification. Research and preparedness needs are highlighted.

This article is based on our work in the sovereign debt community, including over 100 interviews with investors, lawyers, economists, and government officials. Despite the publicity surrounding contract reform, in private few participants described the substantive change as an effective response to financial crises; many said it was simply unimportant. They explained their own participation in the shift as a mix of symbolic gesture and political maneuver, designed to achieve goals apart from solving the technical problems for which the new contract terms offered a fix.

	",112.0,"Despite his long-standing opposition to the Miranda doctrine, why did Justice Rehnquist vote to save the Miranda doctrine in Dickerson v. United States?  As written, many prevailing accounts accept Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Dickerson v. United States at face value and disavow the potential of a strategic explanation for his behavior. The difficulty with the non-strategic accounts is their failure to outline explicitly the evidence supporting the uniqueness of their theory. Specifically, these explanations largely ignore the alternative set of preferences that could have produced the Chief's decision. This is troubling because prior social science scholarship demonstrates that a chief justice possesses a unique set of institutional powers that provides significant incentive for him to behave sophisticatedly.  
Many prevailing explanations for Dickerson at a minimum are incomplete because they fail to determine whether his vote and opinion were the result of moderation, fidelity to traditional legal principles, or, in fact, strategic behavior. This article pursues a uniqueness claim, arguing the available evidence supports a strategic explanation for Justice Rehnquist's behavior in Dickerson. To do this, the article first reviews the methodological debate that exists within the social science scholarship, a debate relevant to the competing explanations for the Dickerson decision. Next, the article explores the strategic or quasi-game theoretic approach by describing the multistage sophisticated process that produces all Supreme Court decisions. It culminates in a general form diagram that maps the behavioral choice faced by all similarly situated Chief Justices'.    
This diagram - inspired by game theoretic literature on judicial decision making - is carried forward into Part II of the article. Part II directly considers the Dickerson decision. This section begins with a description of the Supreme Court's Miranda jurisprudence before reviewing the specific facts and procedural history of the case. Next, Part II reviews Justice Rehnquist's Miranda-related decisions which, taken together, demonstrate the truly anomalous nature of the Dickerson opinion. The article then outlines its strategic account, an approach rejecting many prevailing explanations of Rehnquist's behavior. Strategic and non-strategic behaviors are often observationally equivalent. Thus, in order firmly to support its strategic theory, this article concludes with a discussion of several important post-Dickerson decisions, where the Chief Justice surprisingly supports the preservation of certain exceptions to Miranda even after his Dickerson opinion supposedly afforded Miranda full constitutional status. The cases are critical to the analysis because they help determine what end Chief Justice Rehnquist actually achieved in his Dickerson opinion. He successfully froze a set of pre-Dickerson Miranda exceptions that he personally developed during his thirty-year tenure on the Court. It is from this perspective that commentators in fact are correct to argue that Dickerson is critical to understanding the legacy of the late Chief Justice. "," William Rehnquist, Dickerson v.

	",7.0,"This paper explores the financial impact of medical problems, using data from Phase III of the Consumer Bankruptcy Project, a survey of 1,974 individual bankruptcy petitioners conducted during the first quarter of 1999 in eight federal judicial districts.  Although the questionnaire covered a variety of topics, this paper focuses on debtors' identification of illness or injury as a reason for filing, medical debts, and health insurance coverage.  One out of four debtors, or an estimated 326,441 families in 1999, identified an illness or injury as a reason for filing for bankruptcy.   One third of the debtors said that they had substantial medical bills, i.e., that they had incurred $1,000 or more in medical bills not covered by insurance.  Combining those identifying medical reasons with those indicating substantial medical debts (an overlapping but not perfectly coextensive group), the financial consequences of medical problems were a factor in the bankruptcy cases of an estimated 596,198 families in 1999.  Health insurance coverage was sparse for the group, with one in five debtors reporting that they had no health insurance for any family member.  The absence of insurance, however, did not correlate with a debtor's identifying a medical problem.  Those who had insurance and those who did not were about equally distributed among those who identified a medical problem and those who did not.     
The data were re-analyzed by separating the responses of single filing men, single filing women, and joint filing married couples.  Households without a male present were nearly twice as likely to file for bankruptcy giving a medical reason or identifying a substantial medical debt as households with a male present.   The proportion of debtors providing medical reasons for filing also varied with the debtors' age.

The results show that most investors incur substantial losses on their option investments, which are much larger than the losses from equity trading. We attribute the detrimental impact of option trading on investor performance to poor market timing that results from overreaction to past stock market returns. High trading costs further contribute to the poor returns on option investments. Gambling and entertainment appear to be the most important motivations for trading options while hedging motives only play a minor role.

	",54.0,"This article addresses leading objections to the theory that the President enjoys a residual foreign affairs power by virtue of Article II, Section 1's grant of the ""executive Power."" Opponents dispute the central proposition that the Article II vesting clause vests any independent executive power, and the secondary proposition that the executive power includes foreign affairs power. Yet these objections to the residual theory suffer from conceptual and historical difficulties that greatly undermine their persuasiveness. First, opponents have no competing theory of the Constitution's text, never answering basic questions: Did the Constitution, as originally understood, completely allocate foreign affairs power, and if so, how? Second, opponents of the residual theory rhetorically inflate the powers it would locate in the President.  Critics protest that the Framers did not wish to constitute the President as a king. The residual theory does not lead to presidential supremacy but instead ensures a balanced and divided allocation of foreign affairs powers. Third, critics associate the residual theory with some ill-defined claim of historical or logical inevitability. In fact, the residual theory makes no claims about what the Framers had to do. Instead, it tries to make sense of what they actually did - vesting the  executive power in the President - by examining the historical meaning of the phrase ""executive power"" in the eighteenth century, and by examining how early statesmen, such as Thomas Jefferson, described and justified the President's foreign affairs powers. Finally, to the extent opponents of theory engage these claims, they have little text or history on their side. Despite prodigious efforts, no one is able seriously to dispute that eighteenth century political writers used the phrase ""executive power"" to include foreign affairs power; and that Americans adopted this vocabulary in discussing the Continental Congress, during the drafting and ratifying debates, and in describing President Washington's assertion of key foreign affairs authorities.

	",78.0,"Despite previous historical failed attempts to abolish the Electoral College at the federal level, in the months following the 2000 election, several lawyers, politicians, and academics concocted a novel plan to abolish the College at the State level. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact would be enacted State by State and require each enacting State to give its electoral votes to the winner of a plurality of the national popular vote.    
This Article does not attempt to address the merits or drawbacks of the system as a matter of policy. Instead, Part I begins with a brief history of the Electoral College, how the Compact works, and the current state of affairs regarding the Interstate Compact.  In Part II, the Article analyzes the Compact Clause in Article I section 10 clause 3 of the United States Constitution. It first explores the history of the Clause, with roots that can be found in the Articles of Confederation. It then looks to three different theories of interpretation of the Clause: the Boundary Compact Clause, the Non-Political Compact Clause, and the Political Consent Compact Clause, which are progressively more permissive and have been adopted sequentially in some fashion by the Court, most recently accepting the most expansive interpretation. In adopting the Political Consent Compact Clause theory, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that Congress must consent to a Compact that increases State political power at the expense of federal supremacy, but the Court and commentators have been less forthright when addressing the need for consent when a compact implicates the interests of non-compacting sister States. This Article concludes that non-compacting States are a fundamental concern of the Compact Clause alongside concerns of federal supremacy.    
In Part III, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is examined and found constitutionally deficient. The Compact is actually a compact under the Compact Clause of the Constitution, because the Court has broadly construed what makes a compact. In particular, because the Compact is not effective until a critical mass of States have enacted it, and because States are constrained from withdrawing from the Compact too close to a presidential election, the Compact falls under constitutional scrutiny. Additionally, the Compact addresses a political matter that affects the interests of non-compacting sister States, and the compacting States enhance their political power at the expense of other States. The Article examines the various defenses of the Compact but finds that none of them overcome the political interests of sister States. Therefore, barring congressional consent, the Interstate Compact would fail.

	",5.0,"In this Note, Livermore examines an important and controversial facet of globalization -  the increased prominence and power of international institutions - through a study of the Codex Alimentarius. The Codex is an international food standard-setting body created in 1964 which experienced a significant increase in its authority in 1994 when its standards were incorporated into the World Trade Organization (WTO) regime through the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. Standards that had once been entirely voluntary now have the bite of law in the global trade system. This change has challenged the Codex by subjecting its decision making processes to a higher standard of accountability while at the same time undermining the deliberations which were at the heart of its successful functioning and claim of legitimacy. This Note argues that deliberation within the Codex alone is unlikely to solve this legitimacy dilemma but that the structure of the WTO regime, which divides power between multiple independent bodies, creates the possibility of an external check on the Codex in the form of judicial review exercised by the WTO Appellate Body. Livermore proposes that the Appellate Body review the decision making of the Codex for procedural fairness and appropriate consideration of the views of minority states. Livermore also considers lessons that the successes and difficulties of the Codex have for the design of international regimes in the future.

	",,"One of the oddest things to an outsider about the United States patent system is that due to continuation practice it is impossible for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) ever to finally reject a patent application.  Continuation applications have led to abuse of the patent prosecution process.  They serve very little useful purpose, and what benefits they confer may be outweighed by their potential for mischief.  In an effort to study the pervasiveness of continuation practice, we compiled an original dataset comprising 2,224,379 patents, every patent issued from 1976 through 2000.  We found that while continuations are filed in 23% of all patent applications, patents based on continuation applications represent 52% of all litigated patents.  Although continuations are used in a minority of all patents, it is the most important minority because it is the minority most likely to end up in litigation.  We examine the efforts undertaken to control the problems associated with continuation patents (changing the patent term, publishing applications, prosecution laches) and find them insufficient.  The world would probably be a better place if they were abolished.  Recognizing, however, that the abuse of continuation practice is not as pervasive as some might think, we propose a number of means by which Congress and the courts could strengthen existing rules designed to limit their abuse while preserving the practice.  At a minimum, the empirical data we present can provide litigants and judges with a baseline for assessing the reasonableness of delay caused by the filing of multiple continuations by the patentee in determining the applicability of equitable remedies such as prosecution laches.

	",56.0,"This paper investigates the nature of unemployment among young men in urban Ethiopia and finds that it is concentrated among relatively well-educated first-time job seekers who aspire to a public sector job and spend on average close to four years in unemployment. This is consistent with a segmented labor market model where youngsters queue in unemployment for a good job, as confirmed by an empirical test of the theoretical prediction. We observe a negative (causal) relationship between household welfare and both the incidence and duration of unemployment, indicating that unemployment is concentrated among the relatively worse off urban households, which from a national perspective represent the middle classes, and find suggestive evidence that part of this effect is due to malnutrition during childhood. Job search through social networks is only effective after one has become unemployed, suggesting that networks provide insurance only after exposure to the risk.

	",18.0,"One of the oddest things to an outsider about the United States patent system is that due to continuation practice it is impossible for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) ever to finally reject a patent application.  Continuation applications have led to abuse of the patent prosecution process.  They serve very little useful purpose, and what benefits they confer may be outweighed by their potential for mischief.  In an effort to study the pervasiveness of continuation practice, we compiled an original dataset comprising 2,224,379 patents, every patent issued from 1976 through 2000.  We found that while continuations are filed in 23% of all patent applications, patents based on continuation applications represent 52% of all litigated patents.  Although continuations are used in a minority of all patents, it is the most important minority because it is the minority most likely to end up in litigation.  We examine the efforts undertaken to control the problems associated with continuation patents (changing the patent term, publishing applications, prosecution laches) and find them insufficient.  The world would probably be a better place if they were abolished.  Recognizing, however, that the abuse of continuation practice is not as pervasive as some might think, we propose a number of means by which Congress and the courts could strengthen existing rules designed to limit their abuse while preserving the practice.  At a minimum, the empirical data we present can provide litigants and judges with a baseline for assessing the reasonableness of delay caused by the filing of multiple continuations by the patentee in determining the applicability of equitable remedies such as prosecution laches.

	",49.0,"The ""Fed Model"" has become a very popular yardstick for judging whether the U.S. stock market is fairly valued. The Fed Model compares the stock market's earnings yield (E/P) to the yield on long-term government bonds. In contrast, traditional methods evaluate the stock market purely on its own without regard to the level of interest rates. My goal is to examine the theoretical soundness, and empirical power for forecasting stock returns, of both the ""Fed Model"" and the ""Traditional Model"". The logic most often cited in support of the Fed Model is that stocks should yield less and cost more when bond yields are low, as stocks and bonds are competing assets. Unfortunately, this reasoning compares a real number to a nominal number, ignoring the fact that over the long-term companies' nominal earnings should, and generally do, move in tandem with inflation. In other words, while it is a very popular metric, there are serious theoretical flaws in the Fed Model. Empirical results support this conclusion.  The crucible for testing a valuation indicator is how well it forecasts long-term returns, and the Fed Model fails this test, while the Traditional Model has strong forecasting power. Long-term expected real stock returns are low when starting P/Es are high and vice versa, regardless of starting nominal interest rates. I also examine the usefulness of the Fed Model for explaining how investors set stock market P/Es. That is, does the market contemporaneously set P/Es higher when interest rates are lower? Note the difference between testing whether the Fed Model makes economic sense, and thus forecasts future long-term returns, versus testing whether it explains how investors set current P/Es. If investors consistently confuse the real and nominal, high P/Es will indeed be contemporaneously explained by low nominal interest rates, but these high P/Es lead to low future returns regardless. I confirm that investors have indeed historically required a higher stock market P/E when nominal interest rates have been lower and vice versa. In addition, I show that this relationship is somewhat more complicated than described by the simple Fed Model, varying systematically with perceptions of long-term stock and bond market risk. This addition of perceived risk to the Fed Model also fully explains the previously puzzling fact that stocks ""out yielded"" bonds for the first half of the 20th century, but have ""under yielded"" bonds for the last 40 years. Finally, I note that as of the writing of this paper, the stock market's P/E (based on trend earnings) is still very high versus history. A major underpinning of bullish pundits' defense of this high valuation is the Fed Model I discredit. Sadly, the Fed Model perhaps offers a contemporaneous explanation of why P/Es are high, but no true solace for long-term investors.

	",5.0,"County of Wayne v. Hathcock is an important step forward in public use takings law. The Michigan Supreme Court was right to overturn its notorious 1981 Poletown decision and forbid condemnations that transfer property to private parties solely on the grounds that the new owners will contribute to economic development. Poletown was the best known and most widely criticized decision justifying a nearly unlimited condemnation power.    
As the Poletown case dramatically demonstrates, the economic development rationale is a virtual blank check for eminent domain abuse for the benefit of private parties. Poletown upheld a condemnation as a result of which 4200 people were uprooted so that General Motors could build a new factory in Detroit. Although GM and the City of Detroit promised that the new plant would create over 6000 jobs for the community, in reality the new plant employed less than half that many workers. By destroying hundreds of homes and numerous businesses, churches, and other institutions, the Poletown condemnations very likely inflicted more economic harm than they created benefits.    
Economic development takings are highly vulnerable to such abuse for three interrelated reasons: the economic development rationale can justify almost any condemnation that benefits a private business; economic development takings rarely receive adequate scrutiny through the political process because of their nontransparent nature; and the absence of binding legal obligations on the new owners to actually produce the promised economic benefits severely exacerbates the danger of interest group manipulation.    
Although the Hathcock case will help curb eminent domain abuse, it is not a panacea. Hathcock still permits condemnations that transfer property to private parties in three sets of circumstances: public necessity of the extreme sort, situations where the public retains some control over the condemned property, and cases where condemnation is justified by facts of independent public significance rather than by the new owners' planned use for the property. All three of these scenarios, particularly the last two, are vulnerable to manipulation and abuse. Hathcock's third category is particularly problematic. It is intended to protect blight condemnations, which historically have often been used to benefit politically influential developers at the expense of the poor and ethnic minorities.

	",44.0,"Courts and scholars have increasingly assumed that intellectual property is a form of property, and have applied the economic insights of Harold Demsetz and other property theorists to condemn the use of intellectual property by others as ""free riding."" In this article, I argue that this represents a fundamental misapplication of the economic theory of property. The economics of property is concerned with internalizing negative externalities - harms that one person's use of land does to another's interest to it, as in the familiar tragedy of the commons. But the externalities in intellectual property are positive, not negative, and property theory offers little or no justification for internalizing positive externalities. Indeed, doing so is at odds with the logic and functioning of the market. From this core insight, I proceed to explain why free riding is desirable in intellectual property cases except in limited circumstances where curbing it is necessary to encourage creativity. I explain why economic theory demonstrates that too much protection is just as bad as not enough protection, and therefore why intellectual property law must search for balance, not free riders.  Finally, I consider whether we would be better served by another metaphor than the misused notion of intellectual property as a form of tangible property.

	",17.0,"We analyze Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio over the 1976 to 2006 period and explore potential explanations for its superior performance.  Contrary to popular belief, we find Berkshire Hathaway invests primarily in large-cap growth rather than ""value"" stocks.  Over the period the portfolio beat the benchmarks in 27 out of 31 years, on average exceeding the S&P 500 Index by 11.14%, the value-weighted index of all stocks by 10.92%, and a Fama and French characteristic-based portfolio by 8.56% per year.  Although beating the market in all but four years can statistically happen due to chance, incorporating the magnitude by which the portfolio beats the market makes a luck explanation extremely unlikely even after taking into account ex-post selection bias.  We find that Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio is concentrated in relatively few stocks with the top five holdings averaging 73% of the portfolio value.  While increased volatility is normally associated with higher concentration we show the volatility of the portfolio is driven by large positive returns and not downside risk.  The market appears to under-react to the news of a Berkshire Hathaway stock investment since a hypothetical portfolio that mimics the investments at the beginning of the following month after they are publicly disclosed also earns significantly positive abnormal returns of 10.75% over the S&P 500 Index.

One possible cause of excessive trading is overconfidence. Overconfident investors will trade too frequently, that is, the gains overconfident investors realize through trade will be less than they anticipate and may not even offset the costs of trading. By analyzing trading records for 10,000 accounts at a large discount brokerage house, I test whether the securities these investors purchase outperform those they sell by enough to cover the costs of trading. I find the surprising result that, on average, the securities they purchase actually underperform those they sell. This is the case even when trading is not apparently motivated by liquidity demands, tax-loss selling, portfolio rebalancing, or a move to lower-risk securities. I examine return patterns before and after transactions. Return patterns before purchases and sales can be explained by the difficulty of the search for securities to buy, investors' tendency to let their attention be directed by outside sources, the disposition effect, and investors' reluctance to sell short.

	",22.0,"This essay explores the impact of racial discrimination on the imposition of collateral consequences on those convicted of crime. The category of serious crime which is intrinsically most subject to discretionary enforcement is drug law violations; the number of violators far exceeds the criminal justice resources available to investigate, prosecute and punish them. Accordingly, a high level of selectivity is inevitable. At the same time, the best evidence for racially discriminatory prosecution is in the area of drug violations; while most drug offenders are white, most people imprisoned for drug violations are not. African Americans are imprisoned for drug offenses at rates that far exceed their representation in the general population, in the population of drug offenders, in the population of those arrested for drug crimes, and in the population of those convicted of drug crimes.    
The essay also notes that of all categories of crime, drug convictions have been freighted with the most severe collateral consequences. Under statutes which do not apply to convicted rapists, murderers or terrorists, drug offenders may lose student loans and other educational benefits, their drivers' licenses, access to public housing, food stamps and other benefit providing necessities of life. These collateral consequences are so numerous and burdensome that they may interfere with former prisoners' ability to reenter society and support themselves without reoffending. Unfortunately, the legislative history of the development of collateral consequences such as disenfranchisement, like the development of the drug laws themselves, suggests that the laws were enacted with racial minorities in mind. The essay concludes by proposing that jurisdictions reexamine the way in which collateral consequences are imposed.

	",,"Somalia, so named from the Somali inhabitants, lies in East Africa, between the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. The Somali Republic was formed  in the Horn of Africa by the amalgamation of Somalia under Italian trusteeship administration, formerly Italian colony, with the British protectorate of Somaliland in 1960.  The collapse of the State occurred in 1991, when the dictator ruling the country since 1969, was dethroned by a civil war. The paper examines the development of banking system and the monetary management in the Somali Republic  since the achievement of independence up to the beginning of the 70s.  It appears that the financial sector of Somalia was one of the least sophisticated in Africa south of Sahara.  Particular attention is given to the analysis of organization and functions of the Somali National Bank, the central bank. Before the coup d'Ã©tat of 1969, the banking system of  the country was open to expatriate banks and commercial banking business was carried out by the Banking Department of Somali National Bank as well as by branches of four foreign banks: Banco di Roma, Banco di Napoli, National and Grindlays Bank Ltd. and Banque de Port Said.  All the eight branches of foreign  banks were, however, nationalised in 1970 and the reform of  banking system, implemented also by means of concentration and mergers, brought to the establishment of two financial institutions, both state owned: the Somali Commercial Bank and the Somali Savings and Credit Bank. An other public financial institution, devoted solely to medium- and long-term lending, the Development Bank survived. In this two-tier shaped banking system the Somali National Bank had to limit its functions to those typical of a central bank.

	",30.0,"For the last sixty years, African-Americans have been 75% more likely to die during infancy as whites. From the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, however, this racial gap narrowed substantially. We argue that the elimination of widespread racial segregation in Southern hospitals during this period played a causal role in this improvement. Our analysis indicates that Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which mandated desegregation in institutions receiving federal funds, enabled 5,000 to 7,000 additional black infants to survive infancy from 1965-1975 and at least 25,000 infants from 1965-2002. We estimate that by themselves these infant mortality benefits generated a welfare gain of more than $7 billion (2005$) for 1965-1975 and more than $27 billion for 1965-2002. These findings indicate that the benefits of the 1960s Civil Rights legislation extended beyond the labor marker and were substantially larger than recognized previously.

	",,"We report that the price of a 6.5 ounce Coke was 5 cents from 1886 until 1959. Thus, we are documenting a nominal price rigidity that lasted more than 70 years! The case of Coca-Cola is particularly interesting because during the 70-year period there were substantial changes in the soft drink industry as well as two World Wars, the Great Depression, and numerous regulatory interventions and lawsuits, which led to substantial changes in the Coca-Cola market conditions. The nickel price of Coke, nevertheless, remained unchanged. We find that this unusual rigidity is best explained by (1) a contract between the Company and its parent bottlers that encouraged retail price maintenance, (2) a single-coin vending machine technology, which limited the Company's price adjustment options due to limited availability and unreliability of the existing flexible price adjustment technologies, and (3) a single-coin monetary transaction technology, which limited the Company's price adjustment options due to the customer inconvenience cost. We show that these price adjustment costs are of a different nature than the standard menu cost, and their estimates exceed the existing estimates by an order of magnitude. A possible broader relevance of the nickel Coke phenomenon is discussed in the context of Nickel and Dime Stores, which were popular in the US in the late 1800s and the early 1900s.

	",31.0,"Economists since Demsetz have viewed property rights as a way to internalize the external costs and benefits one party's action confers on another. They have thought this internalization desirable, reasoning that if a party didn't capture the full social value of her actions she wouldn't have optimal incentives to engage in those actions. Measured by this standard, IP rights are inefficiently weak. There is abundant evidence that the social value of innovations far exceeds the private value. But there is also good evidence that, contrary to what economists might assume, these spillovers actually encourage greater innovation. The result is a puzzle for Demsetzians.In this article, we offer three insights that help to explain the positive role of innovation spillovers. First, we note that in IP, unlike real property, a wide range of externalities matter, because IP rights are much less certain than property rights, and because the decision to create a legal entitlement will determine whether or not a transaction must occur. Second, we make the point that while society needs some ex ante incentive to innovate, it doesn't need (and doesn't particularly want) full internalization of the benefits of an invention. Third, we observe that even where internalizing externalities is desirable, property rights do not in fact do so perfectly, and they create problematic distortions in circumstances in which the buyer in a transaction makes productive reuse of the work. The result of combining these insights is that at least where innovation is concerned, we cannot rely on the easy equation of property rights with efficient internalization of externalities.

In the face of overwhelming U.S. military and economic power, America's adversaries -- including non-state actors such as al Qa'ida -- are increasingly turning to asymmetric strategies to oppose U.S. interests.       
This essay provides a brief overview of the 'information battlefront' in the confrontation with militant Islamic extremism. In particular, this essay outlines how terror networks are increasingly using advanced information technology and the global communications network to expand their capacity and capability to wage a global insurgency against U.S. interests and surveys what counter-strategies might be employed in response.      
It is beyond the scope of this essay to address the broader political or policy issues relating more generally to the global ""war on terrorism,"" or to address the legal or ethical implications of employing the counter-strategies discussed below in any specific context.

	",,"In presentations before foreign audiences, I have compared the very strong constitutional protection of freedom of speech in the United States with the somewhat lesser protection of freedom of speech provided under the constitutions of other democratic nations and under international human rights norms. My foreign audiences have reacted with astonishment at hearing how far the United States goes in protecting highly offensive forms of speech that the rest of the world prohibits, such as ""hate speech."" The skepticism of my foreign audiences about the sweeping constitutional protection of freedom of speech in the United States is shared by those American constitutional law commentators who have long contended that the Supreme Court has gone ""too far"" in protecting freedom of speech against the government's efforts to prevent and sanction ""harmful speech.""    
Last year I made a presentation to a Humanities Brown Bag Colloquium at Wayne State in which I asked the participants to explore the difference between constitutional protection of freedom of speech in the United States and ""the rest of the world"" in light of humanistic values. I asked them to consider questions such as whether humanistic values provide guidance as to how strongly we should protect freedom of speech when it takes the form of ""hate speech"" and what most of us would consider ""bad ideas."" Conversely, I asked them to consider whether humanistic values could be relied on to justify the strong constitutional protection that we give to freedom of speech in the United States.    
Much to my surprise, a consensus seemed to emerge. The consensus was that the strong constitutional protection for freedom of speech in the United States was itself an American humanistic value, a value that was the product of our own history and experience, and a value that is reflected in American culture. Thus, in the United States a concern for humanistic values would justify protecting ""bad ideas"" and ""harmful speech"" rather than restricting them. This conclusion was in accord with my long-held position that the strong constitutional protection of freedom of speech in the United States is an integral part of American culture, resulting from our own history and experience. It is an American phenomenon. By the same token, I have also maintained  that other nations, with a different history and experience, could understandably be less protective of freedom of speech than we are. For example, Germany, a nation trying to combat the horrific legacy of Naziism and the Holocaust, surely could not be expected to tolerate any form of ""hate speech"" or any display of Nazi symbols, or any advocacy of genocide. The same might be true of the European nations that endured terrible suffering under the Nazi aggression of World War II and the Holocaust and of the State of Israel.    
But in the United States the strong constitutional protection of freedom of speech is embedded in the American culture of the twenty-first century, and the Supreme Court's expansive interpretation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech serves to implement the values of American society today.

	",61.0,"Although not every technology generates litigation and legal scholarship, technological change is often the occasion for legal problems. Metaphors of law's struggle to keep up with technology reflect the law's failure to cope with technological change. These metaphors have been used in contexts as diverse as railroads, in vitro fertilization, computers, and the Internet. This article seeks to understand why technological change poses such difficulties for the law. It describes four common types of legal problems that arise from technological change: (1) the potential need for laws to ban, restrict or, alternatively, encourage a new technology; (2) uncertainty in the application of existing legal rules to new practices; (3) the possible over-inclusiveness or under-inclusiveness of existing legal rules as applied to new practices; and (4) alleged obsolescence of existing legal rules.     
Using this classification, the Article considers the problem of designing a legal system able to cope in a rapidly changing technological environment. It analyzes the idea of ""technological neutrality"" as a technique of statutory drafting designed to ensure that statutes are able to operate fairly and effectively in diverse technological contexts. It demonstrates that, while such techniques might ensure proper treatment of existing technologies, they are ineffective in a changing technological environment. Instead of focusing on drafting techniques, a broader institutional context is required. The goal should not be technology-neutral legislation, but rather a legal system that continues to treat different technologies fairly and effectively as technology evolves.

	",302.0,"Numerous commentators have suggested that the spread-out, automobile-dependent urban form (often referred to as ""sprawl"") that dominates metropolitan America is at least partially caused by government regulation of land use. Other commentators argue that the fate of Houston, Texas may seem to rebut that theory. Houston is America's only large city without a formal zoning code. Yet Houston is as automobile-dependent and sprawling as many cities with zoning. It could therefore be argued that automobile-dependent sprawl is the inevitable result of the free market, based on the following chain of logic: Assumption 1: Because Houston lacks zoning, Houston has an unregulated, unplanned real estate market. In other words, Houston = the free market at work. Assumption 2: Houston is an automobile-dependent, sprawling city. In other words, Houston = an example of sprawl. Conclusion: Therefore, a city, like Houston, which allows the free market to govern land use will (like Houston) typically become an automobile-dependent, sprawling city-and sprawl is thus a product of the free market, rather than of government interference with consumer preferences. In other words, because Houston = the free market at work, and Houston = sprawl, the free market leads to sprawl. The policy consequence of this chain of logic (at least for people who highly value limited government) is that government should not discourage sprawl, for what the free market has put together, government should not tear asunder. My article rebuts rebuts this conclusion by critiquing one of its underlying assumptions - the assumption that Houston is a free-market role model. In fact, a wide variety of municipal regulatory and spending policies have made Houston more sprawling and automobile-dominated than would a more free-market-oriented set of policies. The article also proposes free-market, anti-sprawl alternatives to those government policies.

	",45.0,"This paper analyzes the factors influencing whether countries become tax havens.  Roughly 15 percent of countries are tax havens; as has been widely observed, these countries tend to be small and affluent.  This paper documents another robust empirical regularity: better-governed countries are much more likely than others to become tax havens.  Controlling for other relevant factors, governance quality has a statistically significant and quantitatively large association with the probability of being a tax haven.  For a typical country with a population under one million, the likelihood of a becoming a tax haven rises from 26 percent to 61 percent as governance quality improves from the level of Brazil to that of Portugal.  Evidence from US firms suggests that low tax rates offer much more powerful inducements to foreign investment in well-governed countries than do low tax rates elsewhere. This may explain why poorly governed countries do not generally attempt to become tax havens, and suggests that the range of sensible tax policy options is constrained by the quality of governance.

This paper presents a general equilibrium growth model in which heterogeneous agents transact and face a moral hazard problem. Agents in this world may trust those with whom they transact, but they also have the opportunity to invest resources in verifying the truthfulness of claims made by transactors. We characterize the social, economic and institutional environments in which trust will be high and show that low trust environments reduce the rate of investment and thus the economy's growth rate. Further, we show that very low trust societies can be caught in a poverty trap. The predictions of the model are examined empirically for a cross-section of countries and have substantial support in the data. Trust is higher in more ethnically, socially and economically homogeneous societies and where legal and social mechanisms for constraining opportunism are better developed. High-trust societies, in turn, exhibit higher rates of investment and growth.

	",5.0,"The impact of newcomer's social similarity and opinion agreement with old timers is examined.  Much of the research about newcomers has ignored the role of social similarity, generally conflating newcomer status with out-group status.  The current investigation addresses this confound by manipulating the social similarity of the newcomer to oldtimers, as well as the level of opinion agreement among the two.  We find that there is a divergence between how socially validated old timers feel and their performance.  In groups with in-group newcomers those that ally with the newcomer feel socially validated, yet perform worse than those who do not ally with the newcomer, whereas allies of out-group newcomers feel less socially validated, but actually perform quite well.  We argue that allying with an out-group newcomer can represent a threat to one's social relationships with fellow in-group members (Phillips, 2003), which leads to an increased task focus that results in superior performance for oldtimers in the group.  Implications for understanding the impact of newcomers on groups will be discussed.

With respect to a large range of issues - defamation, hate speech, publication of information about ongoing legal proceedings, incitement to violence or illegal conduct, and many others - the United States stands alone, not only as compared to totalitarian states, but also in comparison with other open liberal constitutional democracies. The reasons for this divergence are common, but among the explanations are the complexities of the trans-national migration of legal and constitutional ideas, differential commitments to libertarian visions as a matter of basic political theory, differences in the constitutional text, differences in political and legal history, differences in the role of various interest groups, and differences in views about constitutionalism and the role of the courts.

	",7.0,"The contours of the debate about the effect of globalization on the global state system are well known. Perhaps less well understood is the way in which major views of globalization all tend to posit the end of the state system. The result does not change even when considering state friendly conceptions of globalization. More interesting still is that even the great anti-globalization perspectives do little to defend the traditional state system. Whatever the form of opposition, each also essentially posits a global system in which the state plays a subordinate role. For purposes of this paper I broadly describe three views of the nature of globalization. The first proceeds from the logic of the so-called Washington Consensus of private economic transactional neo-liberal globalization. The second looks at economic globalization from a more traditionally state-centered perspective. The third embraces the analytical framework current in certain parts of the developing world and among some major Western religious institutions in which it takes the form of a moral critique of Western led economic globalization. I will show how all three ultimately posit the same consequence for state systems as the foundation of world order - a replacement of the traditional state system as the foundation of law making in the global system of political governance. Each differs only in the nature and form of the system that will replace this system. In the first view all states ultimately suffer the same fate, though perhaps not all at the same time. Political power becomes more diffuse and shared among political, economic, religious, scientific and other communities. The second and third produce a perversion of the state system with a few hyper-states acting as the driving force of international norm making over an amalgamation of other actors, including states, and other political, economic, scientific, religious and related communities. All perspectives also imply that an Aristotelian form of aristocratic governance will result at the global level beyond the nation-state level - in which a few states will effectively govern for the community of nations, subject to a set of norms that transcend national boundaries. But the processes I describe, which in every variation appears to claim the state as a casualty of globalization, is both messier and more complicated than the three models of crisis suggest. I end this essay with a nod to the messiness. Simultaneously developing alongside globalization, or surviving its ascendancy, are other systems incompatible with and likely to engage in conflicts for dominance with both the current system and the ascending system of globalization. These threats arise primarily from three sources. The first include alternative universalizing systems of global organization, based principally in religion. The second include universalizing systems in decline, principally the Marxist-Leninist vision of the past century. The last include anti-universalizing systems and anarchistic systems, from anti-globalization groups, to eco-activists, to old-fashioned conservatives. It seems that the only defense of the traditional state systems is essentially reactionary and increasingly anachronistic. The consequence for the traditional state system appears to be the same, whatever the form of globalization embraced, from the most benign to the most aggressive, and whatever the character of opposition to globalization endorsed. The attachment to a particular nation-state bounded by a finite territory no longer appears to be the critical factor in the debate about globalization.

The essay moves through a look at the coup of 22 November 2000 and then proceeds to look at the analogous dynamics of the Reichstagsbrand/Ermaechtigungsgesetz and 9/11-USA Patriot Act.  Next, the essay examines the role of sovereignty in states of exception and the role of the decider, as developed from the Weimar Constitution's Art. 48 and Carl Schmitt to John Yoo.  Finally, the essay touches upon the ironic and pernicious role of radical human rights discourses in abetting an imperialist agenda.  The essay concludes by considering whether the legal, moral, political, and social construct of the West, which the US has shared with Europe for over half a century, has now come to an end in an era of unchallenged, if ineffective, American hegemony.

	",38.0,"The theory of terrorism as a political disorder is neutral in that it rejects national perspectives. It focuses on the disorder that causes terrorism, but does not distinguish between terrorists and freedom fighters. From this basis, the article argues that an international political disorder that causes terrorism is a dispute within the meaning of Article 33 of the United Nations Charter, which mandates that the parties to any dispute shall, first of all, seek a solution by peaceful means including negotiation.12 Unless the parties to a dispute - the aggrieved group, the suppressive states, and the supportive states - are willing to resolve the political disorder through a negotiated settlement, the problems of terrorism will remain. Finally, the article explores the inefficacy of existing remedies to counter terrorism, and argues that the current trend of non-negotiation between the parties not only undermines Article 33 of the Charter but intensifies the problems of international terrorism.

Like any other media company, search engines affirmatively control their users' experiences, which has the consequence of skewing search results (a phenomenon called ""search engine bias"").  Some commentators believe that search engine bias is a defect requiring legislative correction.  Instead, this Essay argues that search engine bias is the beneficial consequence of search engines optimizing content for their users.

	",92.0,"In Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co., the Delaware Supreme Court made clear that the board of directors of a target corporation is not a passive instrumentality in the face of an unsolicited tender offer or other takeover bid.  To the contrary, so long as the target board's actions are neither coercive nor preclusive, the target's board remains the defender of the metaphorical medieval corporate bastion and the protector of the corporation's shareholders.    
Unocal is almost universally condemned in the academic corporate law literature.  Building on his director primacy model of corporate governance and law, however, Bainbridge offers a defense of Unocal in this article.  Bainbridge argues that Unocal strikes an appropriate balance between two competing but equally legitimate goals of corporate law: on the one hand, because the power to review differs only in degree and not in kind from the power to decide, the discretionary authority of the board of directors must be insulated from shareholder and judicial oversight in order to promote efficient corporate decision making; on the other hand, because directors are obligated to maximize shareholder wealth, there must be mechanisms to ensure director accountability. The Unocal framework provides courts with a mechanism for filtering out cases in which directors have abused their authority from those in which directors have not.

	",34.0,"The results of a cross-country empirical analysis suggest that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of corruption: democracy, parliamentary systems, political stability, and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption.    
Using a cross-country panel, Lederman, Loayza, and Soares examine the determinants of corruption, paying particular attention to political institutions that increase political accountability. Previous empirical studies have not analyzed the role of political institutions, even though both the political science and the theoretical economics literature have indicated their importance in determining corruption.    
The main theoretical hypothesis guiding the authorsi empirical investigation is that political institutions affect corruption through two channels: political accountability and the structure of the provision of public goods.    
The results suggest that political institutions are extremely important in determining the prevalence of corruption: democracy, parliamentary systems, political stability, and freedom of the press are all associated with lower corruption. In addition, the authors show that common findings of the earlier empirical literature on the determinants of corruption related to openness and legal traditionÃ³do not hold once political variables are taken into account.

	",63.0,"Consumers claim to hate marketing - mostly, because they get too much unwanted marketing.  In response, regulators develop medium-by-medium marketing suppression regulations.  Unfortunately, these ad hoc solutions do little to satisfy consumers, and dynamic technologies and business practices quickly render them moot.  Instead of continuing this cycle, there would be some benefit to developing a cross-media marketing regulatory scheme.    
However, any holistic solution must be predicated on a clear rationale for regulating marketing.  The most common justification is that marketing imposes a negative externality on consumers, but this argument ignores the private and social welfare created by marketing and can lead to cost overinternalization and marketing undersupply.    
The Coase Theorem also suggests that social welfare improves by reducing the costs of matching marketers with interested consumers.  To achieve this, consumers need a low cost but accurate mechanism to manifest their preferences.  This Article shows that typical regulatory and marketplace solutions do not provide effective mechanisms.    
Instead, marketer-consumer matchmaking will improve from technology that will automatically infer consumer preferences and use these inferences to filter incoming marketing and seek out wanted content.  This technology is rapidly emerging, but regulation of surreptitious monitoring devices (like adware and spyware) may inadvertently block the development of this socially-beneficial technology.  As a result, current regulatory overreactions to developing technology may counterproductively foreclose social welfare improvements.

Success in the industry requires enforcing executory agreements that are beyond the reach of public courts, and Jewish diamond merchants enforce such contracts with a reputation mechanism supported by a distinctive set of industry, family, and community institutions. An industry arbitration system publicizes promises that are not kept.  Intergenerational legacies induce merchants to deal honestly through their very last transaction, so that their children may inherit valuable livelihoods. And ultra-Orthodox Jews, for whom participation in their communities is paramount, provide important value-added services to the industry without posing the threat of theft and flight.

	",16.0,"The Supreme Court's 2005 decision in Kelo v. City of New London, which upheld the power of government to condemn private property for purposes of economic development, generated a massive political backlash from across the political spectrum. Over forty states, as well as the federal government, have enacted post-Kelo reform legislation to curb eminent domain. This Article is the first comprehensive analysis of the legislative response to Kelo. It challenges the validity of claims that the political backlash to Kelo will provide the same sort of protection for property owners as would a judicial ban on economic development takings. Most of the newly enacted post-Kelo reform laws are likely to be ineffective.   
Part I describes the Kelo decision and documents the widespread anger it generated. Both state-level and national surveys show overwhelming public opposition to economic development takings - opposition that cuts across racial, gender, political, and socioeconomic divisions. The backlash against Kelo is the largest against any Supreme Court decision in decades, and the legislative response is possibly the most extensive to any Supreme Court decision in history.  
Part II analyzes the state and federal political response to Kelo. Thirty-six state legislatures have enacted post-Kelo reform laws. However, twenty-two of these are largely symbolic in nature, providing little or no protection for property owners. Several of the remainder either have significant loopholes or were enacted by states that had little or no history of condemning property for economic development. The major exceptions to the pattern of ineffective post-Kelo reforms are the eleven states that recently enacted reforms by popular referendum. Strikingly, citizen-initiated referendum initiatives have led to the passage of much stronger laws than those enacted through referenda initiated by state legislatures.  
Finally, Part III advances a tentative explanation for the pattern of ineffective post-Kelo reform, in spite of overwhelming public sentiment in favor of such legislation. I contend that the ineffectiveness of post-Kelo reform is largely due to widespread political ignorance. Survey data collected for this Article shows that only 13% of Americans know whether or not their home state has enacted effective post-Kelo eminent domain reform.

	",88.0,"Why do white men fear various risks less than women and minorities? Known as the white male effect, this pattern is well documented but poorly understood. This paper proposes a new explanation: identity-protective cognition. Putting work on the cultural theory of risk together with work on motivated cognition in social psychology suggests that individuals selectively credit and dismiss asserted dangers in a manner supportive of their preferred form of social organization. This dynamic, it is hypothesized, drives the white male effect, which reflects the risk skepticism that hierarchical and individualistic white males display when activities integral to their cultural identities are challenged as harmful. The article presents the results of an 1,800-person study that confirmed that cultural worldviews interact with the impact of gender and race on risk perception in patterns that suggest cultural-identity-protective cognition. It also discusses the implication of these findings for risk regulation and communication.

The annual alpha spread of global low versus high volatility decile portfolios amounts to 12% over the 1986-2006 period. We also observe this volatility effect within the US, European and Japanese markets in isolation. Furthermore, we find that the volatility effect cannot be explained by other well-known effects such as value and size. Our results indicate that equity investors overpay for risky stocks. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include (i) leverage restrictions, (ii) inefficient two-step investment processes, and (iii) behavioral biases of private investors.

This paper evaluates the empirical success of a variety of financial market instruments in predicting the future path of monetary policy. All of the instruments we consider provide forecasts that are clearly superior to those of standard time series models at all of the horizons considered. Among financial market instruments, we find that federal funds futures dominate all the other securities in forecasting monetary policy at horizons out to six months. For longer horizons, the predictive power of many of the instruments we consider is very similar. In addition, we present evidence that monetary policy shocks computed using the current-month federal funds futures contract are influenced by changes in the timing of policy actions that do not influence the expected course of policy beyond a horizon of about six weeks. We propose an alternative shock measure that captures changes in market expectations of policy over slightly longer horizons.

	",102.0,"This essay treats the postwar proliferation of nonprofit organizations as part of the emergence of the American welfare state. As leader of the ""free world,"" the United States had to develop tools of economic, social, and political management that would enable it to remain prepared for economic and military mobilization and to maintain domestic economic and political stability.    
Constrained by deep-seated hostility to ""big government,"" policymakers and legislators devised governmental mechanisms that enabled them to achieve these ends without creating European-style central state bureaucracies. While centralizing revenue gathering (through universalization of income taxation) and policymaking in the federal government, the actual tasks of implementing policies was allocated to states, localities, and private sector actors.    
Devolution and privatization, though conventionally associated with the conservative revolution of the 1990s, actually describes the fundamental dynamic of American government over the past half-century. This fact is especially evident in the proliferation of nonprofit organizations whose growth in numbers and influence was encouraged by tax policies, grants, contracts, and purchases of service (including such voucher programs as the GI Bill).    
Inasmuch as privatization actually involves the transfer of government responsibilities to non-governmental entities subvented in a variety of ways by public funds, we must ultimately ask whether this trend represents a reduction in the size of government - or an enormous increase in its scale and scope.

	",81.0,"This paper develops a simple competitive model of CEO pay. A large part of the rise in CEO compensation in the US economy is explained without assuming managerial entrenchment, mishandling of options, or theft. CEOs have observable managerial talent and are matched to assets in a competitive assignment model. Under very general assumptions, using results from extreme value theory, the model determines the level of CEO pay across firms over time, and the pay-sensitivity relations. The model predicts a cross-sectional constant-elasticity relation between pay and firm size. It also predicts that the level of CEO compensation should increase one for one with the average market capitalization of large firms in the economy. Therefore, the six-fold increase of CEO pay between 1980 and 2003 can be fully attributed to the six-fold increase in market capitalization of large US companies. The model can also be used to study other large changes at the top of the income distribution, and offers a benchmark for calibratable corporate finance. We find a minuscule dispersion of CEO talent, which nonetheless justifies large pay levels and differences. The empirical evidence is broadly supportive of our model. The size of large firms explains many of the patterns in CEO pay, in the time series, across industries and across countries.

	",33.0,"We show that there can be significant difference between risk preferences of individual investors and aggregate preferences toward risk in the economy. To demonstrate this, we investigate aggregate properties of an economy where all investors have convex utility functions corresponding to risk seeking behavior. In the case of risk seeking individual agents with identical initial endowments, assuming a budget constraint, and facing perfect competition the aggregate economy is risk neutral. In the case of risk seeking individuals with different initial endowments, we show that if there exists a continuum of wealth classes the economy in the aggregate will exhibit risk averse behavior. Thus, an economy consisting of risk seeking agents can lead to an aggregate economy that is risk averse. We prove that the converse is also true. For an economy that in the aggregate exhibits risk aversion we can construct an economy of all risk seeking agents that in the aggregate produces the given risk averse indifference curve.

	",13.0,"Unlike what is commonly believed, the last two decades have not witnessed the twilight of industrial policy. Instead, incentives and subsidies have been refocused on exports and direct foreign investment, in the belief that these activities are the source of significant positive spillovers. The challenge in most developing countries is not to rediscover industrial policy, but to redeploy it in a more effective manner. This paper lays out an institutional framework for accomplishing this objective. A central argument is that the task of industrial policy is as much about eliciting information from the private sector on significant externalities and their remedies as it is about implementing appropriate policies. The right model for industrial policy is not that of an autonomous government applying Pigovian taxes or subsidies, but of strategic collaboration between the private sector and the government with the aim of uncovering where the most significant obstacles to restructuring lie and what type of interventions are most likely to remove them.

	",25.0,"Option values are well-known to be the integral of a discounted transition density times a payoff function; this is just martingale pricing. It's usually done in 'S-space', where S is the terminal security price. But, for Levy processes the S-space transition densities are often very complicated, involving many special functions and infinite summations. Instead, we show that it's much easier to compute the option value as an integral in Fourier space - and interpret this as a Parseval identity. The formula is especially simple because (i) it's a single integration for any payoff and (ii) the integrand is typically a compact expression with just elementary functions. Our approach clarifies and generalizes previous work using characteristic functions and Fourier inversions. For example, we show how the residue calculus leads to several variation formulas, such as a well-known, but less numerically efficient, 'Black-Scholes style' formula for call options. The result applies to any European-style, simple or exotic option (without path-dependence) under any Levy process with a known characteristic function.

	",15.0,"In this paper, we develop an economic rationale for the following stylized fact: Web-based firms spend profligately on advertising and marketing and usually lose money. Our rationale is based on the winner-take-all structure of high fixed cost, low marginal cost, markets for information goods. This market structure ensures that market participation and investment policy are highly stochastic. Moreover, if a firm chooses to participate in a Web market, it is optimal to act very aggressively through saturation advertising. Although increases in advertising costs reduce the probability of entry, once the decision to enter is made, firm strategies are insensitive to advertising price. Consistent with empirical studies of the profitability of internet firms (Hand, 2001), our model predicts returns that are highly positively skewed, that is, even the firms that survive the competition for market position have a small chance of huge gains combined with a large probability of very modest returns. In dynamic competition, firms weakened by early rounds are less likely to challenge in subsequent rounds. However, when a challenge is attempted, it is always aggressive. In addition, because large expenditures in the first period produce valuable strategic real options in later periods, which are treated as expenses using traditional accounting methodology, the financial valuation of Internet firms may actually be negatively related to performance when using standard accounting measures of profitability that fail to capitalize these strategic real options.

On average, German students participating in this standardized test performed considerably below the OECD average and substantially worse than those of other European countries, like Finland or Ireland. However, the results presented by the report consist mainly of country averages which do not take into account any other covariates of individual student achievement. This paper provides a comprehensive econometric analysis of the association of the individual-level reading test scores of German students with individual and family background information and with characteristics of the school and class of the 15 to 16 year old respondents in Germany to the survey. The results of several quantile regression analyses demonstrate that many popular explanations, like too much regulation of schools or the substantial share of non-citizens among the participating students, are by no means supported by the data. Rather results point towards a considerable impact of schools aiming at a more homogenous body of students in terms of their educational achievement.

We find that (1) more multitasking is associated with more project output, but with diminishing marginal returns, and that (2) recruiters whose network contacts have heterogeneous knowledge â€“ an even distribution of expertise over many project types â€“ are less productive on average but more productive when juggling diverse multitasking portfolios. These results show how multitasking affects productivity and how knowledge networks, enabled by IT, can improve worker performance.

	",,"This paper examines the role of the corporate objective function in corporate productivity and efficiency, social welfare, and the accountability of managers and directors. I argue that since it is logically impossible to maximize in more than one dimension, purposeful behavior requires a single valued objective function. Two hundred years of work in economics and finance implies that in the absence of externalities and monopoly (and when all goods are priced), social welfare is maximized when each firm in an economy maximizes its total market value. Total value is not just the value of the equity but also includes the market values of all other financial claims including debt, preferred stock, and warrants.     
In sharp contrast stakeholder theory, argues that managers should make decisions so as to take account of the interests of all stakeholders in a firm (including not only financial claimants, but also employees, customers, communities, governmental officials, and under some interpretations the environment, terrorists, and blackmailers). Because the advocates of stakeholder theory refuse to specify how to make the necessary tradeoffs among these competing interests they leave managers with a theory that makes it impossible for them to make purposeful decisions. With no way to keep score, stakeholder theory makes managers unaccountable for their actions.  It seems clear that such a theory can be attractive to the self interest of managers and directors.     
Creating value takes more than acceptance of value maximization as the organizational objective. As a statement of corporate purpose or vision, value maximization is not likely to tap into the energy and enthusiasm of employees and managers to create value. Seen in this light, change in long-term market value becomes the scorecard that managers, directors, and others use to assess success or failure of the organization. The choice of value maximization as the corporate scorecard must be complemented by a corporate vision, strategy and tactics that unite participants in the organization in its struggle for dominance in its competitive arena.    
A firm cannot maximize value if it ignores the interest of its stakeholders. I offer a proposal to clarify what I believe is the proper relation between value maximization and stakeholder theory. I call it enlightened value maximization, and it is identical to what I call enlightened stakeholder theory. Enlightened value maximization utilizes much of the structure of stakeholder theory but accepts maximization of the long run value of the firm as the criterion for making the requisite tradeoffs among its stakeholders. Managers, directors, strategists, and management scientists can benefit from enlightened stakeholder theory. Enlightened stakeholder theory specifies long-term value maximization or value seeking as the firm?s objective and therefore solves the problems that arise from the multiple objectives that accompany traditional stakeholder theory.    
I also discuss the Balanced Scorecard, the managerial equivalent of stakeholder theory. The same conclusions hold. Balanced Scorecard theory is flawed because it presents managers with a scorecard which gives no score--that is, no single-valued measure of how they have performed. Thus managers evaluated with such a system (which can easily have two dozen measures and provides no information on the tradeoffs between them) have no way to make principled or purposeful decisions. The solution is to define a true (single dimensional) score for measuring performance for the organization or division (and it must be consistent with the organization's strategy). Given this we then encourage managers to use measures of the drivers of performance to understand better how to maximize their score. And as long as their score is defined properly, (and for lower levels in the organization it will generally not be value) this will enhance their contribution to the firm.

	",23.0,"It is a well-documented empirical regularity that it is more satisfying to be self-employed than to work as an employee for an organization. A large part of this difference in job satisfaction is attributed in the literature to the strong perception of independence by the self-employed. In this paper we study people's time use as a source of entrepreneurial independence. By making use of disaggregated sequential microdata on people's time use, we are able to document that the self-employed work longer effective hours, as well as more in the evenings and weekends, than those employed by an organization. Even though being able to decide when to do one's work may be a sign of flexibility in time use, the self-employed have less pure leisure and are less frequently absent from work in general and when sick on weekdays in particular. Moreover, we document that the self-employed who have small children are more likely to work after 5 p.m., when the communal day-care centres close. Based on these findings it is not surprising that the self-employed perceive that they are more often under time pressure and in a hurry than those employed by an organization.

	",46.0,"Military spending in the West generally declined after the Cold War. Given the economic pressures that many of these states confronted, they can be said to have experienced a fortuitous conjunction of lessening security demands with stable if not rising pressures to allocate more resources to social purposes. However, with declining financial resources a good part of military capital in these countries was reduced and most of what remains is growing obsolete. The excessive rise in relative prices associated with major military capital items, a rise only partially associated with an increase in real effectiveness, poses a challenge for many of these states if they are to retain their capacity to provide in some meaningful way for their own military defense.

	",25.0,"One hundred years ago in the United States, confronted by the urgent need to find a debt workout procedure for large corporate and railroad bond issuers, the financial community looked at three options: amend the U.S. bankruptcy law to permit reorganizations (the predecessor of today's Chapter 11), not just liquidations of the debtor companies; include contractual provisions in the underlying bonds that would allow a restructuring of those instruments with the consent of a supermajority of the bondholders; or pursue a court-supervised debt restructuring by engaging the equitable powers of the civil courts to oversee such a process.    
A century later, confronted by the urgent need to find a debt workout procedure for sovereign bond issuers, the same three options are open for discussion.  The International Monetary Fund is actively studying the possibility of constructing, at the supranational level, the equivalent of a ""Chapter 11 for countries.""  The use of contractual provisions to facilitate sovereign debt workouts - an idea whose time had visibly not come even just a few years ago - is being reconsidered by both the sovereign borrowers and the institutional bondholder community in the light of Argentina's catastrophic debt default in December 2001.  Resort to the equitable powers of the civil courts to oversee creditor-led sovereign debt workouts is, we believe, possible in appropriate circumstances.    
This article looks at the existing contractual provisions in sovereign bonds and the existing U.S. legal procedures in order to explore how far these may be enlisted to further the goal of orderly sovereign debt rearrangements.  This article concludes that these existing contractual provisions and civil procedures - if used creatively and confidently - can go much further toward achieving this goal than conventional wisdom would suggest.

	",41.0,"The increased number of casuals in the Australian workforce has generated considerable concern about a proliferation of inferior jobs in the labour market. Critics of casualisation have pointed to poor outcomes associated with casual work: job insecurity, lack of training and career paths, marginalisation in the workplace and so forth. Those who defend casualisation argue that non-standard employment provides greater choice within the labour market, and that casual employees are no less dissatisfied with their jobs than permanent employees. In this paper, I re-assess this debate by examining a recent analysis of job satisfaction among casual employees by Wooden and Warren in 2004. I argue that findings of contentment among casual employees are subject to both methodological and philosophical weaknesses. In place of subjective measures of job satisfaction, I argue that the quality of jobs should be directly assessed by objective criteria like remuneration. Following this, I fit earnings equations to the HILDA data and find that part-time casual employees earn only a modest premium over permanent full-time employees. When the loadings, which casuals are paid, are taken into account, I find that part-time casual employees are actually penalised by virtue of working as casuals. I conclude that casual jobs are inferior jobs, irrespective of the satisfaction levels of their incumbents.

	",15.0,"The Supreme Court's two-pronged affirmative defense limiting employer liability for sexual harassment, articulated in the Faragher and Ellerth decisions, generated substantial scholarly commentary. Many scholars were quick to predict how lower courts would apply the affirmative defense. However, many predictions about the affirmative defense were advanced prior to the emergence of a sufficient number of judicial opinions applying it.    
In this article we report results of our empirical study of the first 72 post-Ellerth and Faragher opinions involving employers' summary judgment motions that include affirmative defenses in response to allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace. We find that employer-related factors heavily influence the courts' construction of both prongs of the affirmative defense. Somewhat surprising is the degree to which the courts look to employer conduct when characterizing employee conduct. In our discussion we consider the legal and policy implications generated by an incentive structure informed by the courts' application of the affirmative defense.

	",45.0,"Search-theoretic models of monetary exchange are based on explicit descriptions of the frictions that make money essential. However, tractable versions usually have strong assumptions that make them ill-suited for discussing some policy questions, especially those concerning changes in the money supply. Hence most policy analysis uses reduced-form models. We propose a framework that attempts to bridge this gap: it is based explicitly on microeconomic frictions, but allows for interesting macroeconomic policy analyses. At the same time, the model is analytically tractable and amenable to quantitative analysis.

	",,"This essay, a chapter in a book of essays by law professors, historians, and political scientists edited by Jack Rakove, traces the doctrinal developments in equal protection law that culminated in the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore. It opens with a discussion of how the political question doctrine and the Supreme Court's decisions in Giles v. Harris and other cases involving elections led it to use the equal protection clause to police the political process. It then identifies aspects of the Court's one-person, one-vote decisions that set the stage for Bush v. Gore. It also traces the tortuous relationship between the Court and Congress over the enforcement of principles of political equality. The essay then turns to the Court's treatment of equal protection precedents in Bush v. Gore itself. Here, I point out ways in which the Florida situation resembled and differed from earlier equal protection cases, with respect both to the contours of the violation and, more importantly, with respect to the remedy imposed.    
Given the tenuousness of the equal protection analysis, the question becomes why the Court relied on that rationale. I suggest a political, but not exactly partisan, explanation. As between the equal protection clause - source of some of the Supreme Court's finest moments, in cases such as Brown v. Board of Education and Reynolds v. Sims - and Article II, S 1 - the central pillar of at most a nineteenth-century case concerning how Michigan selected its electors - the choice was clear. If the Supreme Court was going to stop the recount process, and thus decide, in effect, who would be the next President of the United States, it had to use a constitutional provision with a celebrated and unassailable pedigree. The equal protection clause provided exactly that. Moreover, it allowed the Court to invoke the specter of unfairly disenfranchised voters, whereas the other available constitutional contenders protected either the prerogative of state legislatures (Article II, S 1) or, even worse, the interests of a particular candidate, George W. Bush (the due process clause).

	",107.0,"Courts, lawyers, and scholars have long assumed that The Federalist Papers supply important information for use in constitutional argument and interpretation.  In recent years, commentators have questioned this view.  Their skepticism grows out of two major concerns.  First, Justice Scalia's recent challenge to the use of legislative history in the statutory context casts a cloud over judicial use of background texts such as The Federalist in seeking the meaning of the Constitution.  Second, even if courts may rely on some background materials in interpreting the Constitution, there is reason to conclude that The Federalist does not qualify as the sort of material that provides useful guidance.  The basic difficulty is that the authors of The Federalist wrote their essays as advocacy documents for publication in local newspapers, rather than as scholarly texts designed to lay out in neutral fashion the purposes and themes of the Constitution.  Building on this historical reality, analysts have properly asked why courts should view a series of editorials, churned out to help win a heated political battle, as a key modern-day source of constitutional interpretation.    
In this article, Professor Coenen explores the proper role of The Federalist in the search for constitutional meaning.  He demonstrates that the essays were in fact sophisticated advocacy documents that wove together different styles of rhetoric designed to win over readers to the cause of ratification.  This reality, in Coenen's view, requires courts to approach the papers with a measure of caution.  At the same time, Coenen rejects the view that the campaign-literature purpose of The Federalist disqualifies it from serving as an important touchstone of constitutional interpretation.  This is the case primarily because the authors of The Federalist, in conceiving and structuring their argument, focused on making a highly rational and comprehensive appeal to a broad and diverse audience.  Against this backdrop, Coenen concludes, The Federalist should be viewed as setting forth something akin to a consensus understanding of Constitution.

CEOs have observable managerial talent and are matched to assets in a competitive assignment model. The marginal impact of a CEO's talent is assumed to increase with the value of the assets under his control. Under very general assumptions, using results from extreme value theory, the model determines the level of CEO pay across firms and over time, and the pay-sensitivity relations. The model predicts the cross-sectional Cobb-Douglas relation between pay and firm size. It also predicts that the level of CEO compensation should increase one for one with the average market capitalization of large firms in the economy. Therefore, the five-fold increase of CEO pay between 1980 and 2000 can be fully attributed to the increase in market capitalization of large US companies. The model can also be used to study other large changes at the top of the income distribution, and offers a benchmark for calibratable corporate finance.

Whether the U.S. government should be allowed to claim credit for the private philanthropy of its citizens is a hot topic in today's foreign aid debate.  Overlooked in this debate, however, is a form of aid that straddles the traditional public/private divide: charitable tax expenditures.  Through the many tax privileges that the United States grants to its nonprofit organizations, the government implicitly foots some portion of the bill anytime these organizations send money abroad for development purposes.  Unlike official development assistance (ODA), these tax expenditure funds are privately organized and distributed, yet unlike voluntary transfers they are paid for by the public fisc.  This is not private aid; it is privatized aid.  At the same time that direct expenditures on aid were falling in recent decades, these tax expenditures were rising.      
The basic, descriptive goal of this Comment is to show how nonprofit tax policies have shaped the content of American aid.  The broader goal is to connect this insight with the literatures on tax expenditures and international development.  If one accepts the Comment's theoretical premise, then U.S. government spending on aid is somewhat larger, and substantially different in character, than most commentators have assumed.  Although tax expenditures on foreign aid raise a number of concerns, they also, I contend, possess unique virtues that can make them a valuable complement to ODA.

The studies tested hypotheses on differential contagion effects due to the degree of pleasantness of the emotion, and the energy with which this pleasantness was conveyed. After determining that emotional contagion existed in groups, I then examined the influence of emotional contagion on individual-level attitudes and group processes. As predicted, experiencing positive emotional contagion led to  improved cooperation, decreased conflict, and increased perceptions of task performance - all as rated by self, other group members, and outside video-coders. The opposite was the case when experiencing negative emotional contagion. Theoretical implications and practical ramifications of emotional contagion in groups and organizations are discussed.

	",,"The Catholic Church's opposition to the death penalty places Catholic judges in a moral and legal bind. While these judges are obliged by oath, professional commitment, and the demands of citizenship to enforce the death penalty, they are also obliged to adhere to their church's teaching on moral matters. Although the legal system has a solution for this dilemma by allowing the recusal of judges whose convictions keep them from doing their job, Catholic judges will want to sit whenever possible without acting immorally. However, litigants and the general public are entitled to impartial justice, which may be something a judge who is heedful of ecclesiastical pronouncements cannot dispense. Therefore, the authors argue, we need to know whether judges are legally disqualified from hearing cases that their consciences would let them decide. While mere identification of a judge as Catholic is not sufficient reason for recusal under federal law, the authors suggest that the moral impossibility of enforcing capital punishment in such cases as sentencing, enforcing jury recommendations, and affirming are in fact reasons for not participating.

In practice, however, the rights afforded to patent holders are highly uncertain.  Under patent law, a patent is no guarantee of exclusion but more precisely a legal right to try to exclude.  Since only 0.1% of all patents are litigated to trial, and since nearly half of fully litigated patents are declared invalid, this distinction is critical to understanding the economic impact of patents.  The growing recognition among economists and legal scholars that patents are probabilistic property rights has significant implications for our understanding of patents in four important areas: (1) reform of the system by which patents are granted; (2) the legal treatment of patents in litigation; (3) the incentives of patent holders and alleged infringers to settle their disputes through licensing or cross-licensing agreements rather than litigate them to completion; and (4) the antitrust limits on agreements between rivals that settle actual or threatened patent litigation.

	",,"Despite the apparent divergence in institutions of governance, share ownership, capital markets, and business culture across developed economies, the basic law of the corporate form has already achieved a high degree of uniformity, and continued convergence is likely.  A principal reason for convergence is a widespread normative consensus that corporate managers should act exclusively in the economic interests of shareholders, including noncontrolling shareholders.  This consensus on a shareholder-oriented model of the corporation results in part from the failure of alternative models of the corporation, including the manager-oriented model that evolved in the U.S. in the 1950's and 60's, the labor-oriented model that reached its apogee in German co-determination, and the state-oriented model that until recently was dominant in France and much of Asia.  Other reasons for the new consensus include the competitive success of contemporary British and American firms, the growing influence worldwide of the academic disciplines of economics and finance, the diffusion of share ownership in developed countries, and the emergence of active shareholder representatives and interest groups in major jurisdictions.  Since the dominant corporate ideology of shareholder primacy is unlikely to be undone, its success represents the ""end of history"" for corporate law.    
The ideology of shareholder primacy is likely to press all major jurisdictions toward similar rules of corporate law and practice.  Although some differences may persist as a result of institutional or historical contingencies, the bulk of legal development worldwide will be toward a standard legal model of the corporation.  For the most part, this development will enhance the efficiency of corporate laws and practices.  In some cases, however, jurisdictions may converge on inefficient rules, as when the universal rule of limited shareholder liability permits shareholders to externalize the costs of corporate torts.

They promote broad public debate, stimulate voter participation, and are the central means by which voters hold officeholders accountable. Yet as is now widely recognized, such elections are in decline in the United States, due in part to the intentional and systematic creation of artificially safe election districts.    
This article provides a constitutional framework for responding to this problem. In recent years, the Supreme Court has more aggressively enforced constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress's enumerated powers. In the same way, the Court has begun to enforce limits on the Art. I, Sec. 4 power of state legislatures to set the ground rules for congressional elections. Art. 1, Sec. 4 is the only source of constitutional power states have to regulate national elections. But just as Congress' powers under Art. I are limited to the scope and purposes for which granted, the Art. I enumerated power does not authorize state legislatures to design congressional districts with the systematic and intentional aim and effect of creating artificially non-competitive election districts. Not all election districts can be made competitive, nor is competitiveness the only relevant democratic and constitutional value. But state legislative manipulation of congressional districts that intentionally and systematically aims to create overwhelmingly safe election districts is not within the purposes or scope of the power Art. I grants. More generally, Art. I is an important source of limitation on the ability of states to manipulate national elections.

	",13.0,"A substantial number of outside directors have experience in non-business arenas, especially in government and in the private practice of law. Moreover, for most of these directors, the entirety of their experience is outside of business. We propose a political role for such directors and argue that they are selected, at least in part, because of their value in enlisting government favors or forestalling government constraints. To assess this possibility, we analyze the backgrounds of the 3,220 directors of 264 large U.S. manufacturing firms. We also compile a novel dataset that contains detailed measures of the importance of politics to firms.    
We have three main findings. First, we find that outside directors with political and legal backgrounds appear to be chosen, at least in part, because of this experience. Second, we find that such directors are more common on the boards of firms for which politics is more important. Both findings are consistent with a political role for these outside directors. Third, we explore the possibility that recent findings showing a negative relation between firm performance and both board size and the proportion of outside directors could be driven by politics. Specifically, politics may lead simultaneously to larger and more outsider oriented boards and to poorer firm performance. We assess this possibility by including, first, the incidence of directors with political or legal backgrounds and, second, our measures of the importance of politics in regressions that find this negative effect of board size and composition on firm performance. Although our results are modest, the added political variables are typically negatively related to firm performance and the addition of these variables weakens the effect of both board size and board composition on firm performance. This is evidence consistent with politics underlying the negative relation between board size and composition and firm performance. Overall, this paper provides empirical evidence on an important, but neglected, role of corporate boards and provides a rational explanation of the otherwise puzzling negative relation between firm performance and both board size and the proportion of outside directors.

The approach endeavors to integrate insights of social psychology, and affiliated social sciences, together with the methods of conventional economic analysis, as well as traditional methods of legal inquiry.  Canvassing robust findings from across the behavioral sciences, the authors articulate a framework for thinking about human agency in legal analysis that the authors call ""the situational character,"" a conception which is meant to provide a more scientifically grounded understanding of the sources of human behavior and decision-making then is provided by the ""rational actor"" model that has become so prominent in legal scholarship through the influence of the law and economics movement.  The authors further explore the extend to which market-actors, such as corporations, have a stake in promoting to consumers and to policymakers the rational-actor model of human agency, even as market pressures are likely to lead such market-actors to understand and exploit the reality of the ""situational character.""  The authors refer to such efforts on the part of market-actors as ""deep capture,"" an extension of the conception of administrative ""capture"" long understood by public choice theorists.  The authors review several historical episodes and scholarly debates through the innovative framework that their article provides, and suggest many avenues of future research and development of the framework.

Like many environmental amenities, there may be a nonuse or existence value of working for a company that offers employer-sponsored child care (ESCC), as well as a use value to parents who have children in the center. We test this hypothesis using data from three firms, two of which have on-site child care. Our findings indicate that price is a determinant of willingness to pay for the continued existence or establishment of an on-site center. We find evidence of the existence value, even for employees without young children, and a greater valuation among recent hires than among longer-term employees.

Why do certain foreign communities tend to build an ethnic economy, and others melt in the economy of the reception country? The analysis made so far of the modes of incorporation of the different Chinese immigrant communities in Portugal allowed to evidence that, unlike what some authors defend, it is not only the cultural factors that channel immigrants into certain segments of the labour market. Several structural factors associated to these immigrants' arrival should be considered: the immigration policy of the host society; the reasons that generated the migratory flow; the existence of a co-ethnic community in the country and its economic incorporation; the operation of social networks; the possibility to acquire capital among the community (informal resources); and the potential market of the host society. Furthermore, in Portugal, as in Southern Europe, the informal economy can be an opportunity to self-employment - not so easy in North European countries where institutional control is stronger and competition is higher.

But once a corporate debtor enters bankruptcy - in particular, chapter 11 - it enters a bargaining process that was bottomed on a model of creditor behavior that may no longer hold because of credit derivatives. A creditor may not act like a traditional creditor if they no longer face the risk of non-payment because that risk has been hedged.

	",9.0,"This Foreword introduces a Symposium issue of the Wisconsin Law Review devoted to the New Legal Realism Project.  The NLR Project is aimed at developing a sophisticated interdisciplinary approach for translating social science in legal settings.  One core focus is combining qualitative and quantitative research to yield a more accurate picture of law and how it operates - from the ground-level up as well as from the top down.  Another feature is NLR's insistence that we deal more systematically with the issue of translation among disciplines, rather than assume (generally incorrectly) that we share identical assumptions, epistemologies, and practices.  Problematizing translation implies a more careful assessment of the impact of the sociology of knowledge itself.  The co-authors of this Foreword also ask about global dimensions to studying law.  They call for a new form of optimistic engagement between social science research and legal policy issues, based in pragmatism (of several varieties).    
The Foreword proceeds to demonstrate the pragmatic orientation of NLR by using two examples of the approach being advocated.  The first example provided is Larson's research on the colonias, squatter settlements on the border between Texas and Mexico. This research moved from detailed ethnographic and in-person household survey research through policy recommendations and eventually to monitoring of the implementation of those recommendations.  Wilkins' in-depth interviewing of black attorneys in large law firms forms the basis of the second example, which demonstrates how on-the-ground research can shed light on the complexities involved in integrating the legal profession.  In a third section, the authors explore the possible role of pragmatist theory in formulating a new legal realism.  This section is followed by a discussion of how interdisciplinary empirical research might be integrated into law teaching.  A final section of the Foreword outlines the Symposium articles.  The New Legal Realism Project received its start from a collaboration between the American Bar Foundation and the Institute for Legal Studies at the University of Wisconsin Law School, both long-time leaders in the effort to bring truly interdisciplinary empirical research to bear on legal problems.

The intersection of the word fuck and the law is examined in four major areas: First Amendment, broadcast regulation, sexual harassment, and education.  The legal implications from the use of fuck vary greatly with the context.  To fully understand the legal power of fuck, the nonlegal sources of its power are tapped.  Drawing upon the research of etymologists, linguists, lexicographers, psychoanalysts, and other social scientists, the visceral reaction to fuck can be explained by cultural taboo.  Fuck is a taboo word.  The taboo is so strong that it compels many to engage in self-censorship.  This process of silence then enables small segments of the population to manipulate our rights under the guise of reflecting a greater community.  Taboo is then institutionalized through law, yet at the same time is in tension with other identifiable legal rights.  Understanding this relationship between law and taboo ultimately yields fuck jurisprudence.

Yet, in spite of most consumers' extensive experience with watching television, we propose that commercial interruptions can actually improve the television viewing experience. Although consumers do not foresee it, their enjoyment diminishes over time. Commercial interruptions can disrupt this adaptation process and restore the intensity of consumers' enjoyment. Six studies demonstrate that, although people preferred to avoid commercial interruptions, these interruptions actually made programs more enjoyable (study 1), regardless of the quality of the commercial (study 2), even when controlling for the mere presence of the ads (study 3), and regardless of the nature of the interruption (study 4). However, this effect was eliminated for people who are less likely to adapt (study 5), and for programs that do not lead to adaptation (study 6), confirming the disruption of adaptation account and identifying crucial boundaries of the effect.

Employee investment decision making should be examined to determine whether those decisions are influenced by race, ethnicity and/or class.

Low-income whites are far more likely to invest in the stock market than blacks or Hispanics regardless of income.

	",56.0,"This paper examines whether the introduction of the Euro in 1999 was associated with lower stock return volatility, market risk exposures and foreign exchange rate risk exposures for 12,821 nonfinancial firms in Europe, the United States, and Japan. We show that though the Euro led to a significant decrease in the volatility of trade-weighted exchange rates of European countries, stock return variances of nonfinancial firms increased after its introduction. However, the Euro was also accompanied by significant reductions in market risk exposures for nonfinancial firms in and outside of Europe. We show that the reduction in market risk was not as a result of changes in financial leverage, and that it is concentrated in firms with a high fraction of foreign sales in Europe, a high fraction of total foreign sales and larger market capitalizations. In addition to its impact on market betas, the Euro has a positive effect on the incremental foreign exchange rate exposures, particularly for multinationals.

	",43.0,"Many markets have historically been dominated by a small number of best-selling products. The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, describes this common pattern of sales concentration. However, information technology in general and Internet markets in particular have the potential to substantially increase the collective share of niche products, thereby creating a longer tail in the distribution of sales.    
This paper investigates the Internetâ€™s â€œLong Tailâ€ phenomenon. By analyzing data collected from a multi-channel retailer, it provides empirical evidence that the Internet channel exhibits a significantly less concentrated sales distribution when compared with traditional channels. Previous explanations for this result have focused on differences in product availability between channels. However, we demonstrate that the result survives even when the Internet and traditional channels share exactly the same product availability and prices. Instead, we find consumersâ€™ usage of Internet search and discovery tools, such as recommendation engines, are associated with an increase the share of niche products. We conclude that the Internetâ€™s Long Tail is not solely due to the increase in product selection but may also partly reflect lower search costs on the Internet. If the relationships we uncover persist, the underlying trends in technology portend an ongoing shift in the distribution of product sales.

	",148.0,"Two related myths have a remarkable currency among law students, lawyers and the general public.  The first myth is that tax lawyers are somehow different from other lawyers.  Part I of this Article documents how this misperception pervades law schools, the legal profession, and the popular culture.  Although this Part chronicles the disparagement of tax lawyers in a light-hearted fashion (as suggested by the reference to the Willie Nelson song in the title), the Article focuses on the serious consequences caused by the related second myth that tax law is somehow different from other areas of the law.    
As suggested by the reference to tax myopia in the title, the Article contends that tax law too often is mistakenly viewed by lawyers, judges, and law professors as a self-contained body of law.  Part II of the Article explains how this misperception has impaired the development of tax law by ignoring insights from other areas of law that should inform the tax debate.  Similarly, other areas of law have been impoverished by the failure to consider how tax law can enrich their development.  The Article advocates a synergistic relationship between tax and nontax law through which each benefits from the insights of the other.    
Part III of the Article addresses this theme through several fundamental issues concerning the allocation of legislative, executive, and judicial power in our constitutional system.  The Article first injects various statutory construction and legislative process theories developed in the nontax area into the debate over whether the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code requires that tax legislative history be treated differently from its nontax counterparts.  The Article then considers how recent Supreme Court administrative law decisions and the statutory reenactment doctrine affect the amount of deference that courts should give to the Treasury Department's interpretation of tax statutes.  Finally, the Article examines how the empirical and nontax models of the tax litigation system should inform the litigant's choice of the appropriate tax forum, Congress's allocation of tax jurisdiction, and the federal courts' application of state law in tax controversies.    
Although I offer my views on these issues, the thrust of the Article is its advocacy of a cross-pollination approach, rather than a definitive resolution of these structural concerns that have bedeviled tax and nontax law for decades.  By replacing the myopic vision of the tax law with an appreciation of the symbiotic relationship between tax and nontax law, the ultimate resolution of these tax issues will be facilitated by nontax learning, and tax, in turn, will provide a useful laboratory within which to test and refine these nontax principles.

	",24.0,"Prospect theory's S-shaped weighting function is often said to reflect the psychophysics of chance. We propose an affective rather than psychophysical deconstruction of the weighting function resting on two assumptions. First, preferences depend on the affective reactions associated with potential outcomes of a risky choice. Second, even with monetary values controlled, some outcomes are relatively affect-rich and others relatively affect-poor. Although the psychophysical and affective approaches are complementary, the affective approach has one novel implication: weighting functions will be more S-shaped for lotteries involving affect-rich than affect-poor outcomes. That is,people will be more sensitive to departures form impossibility and certainty but less sensitive to intermediate probability variations for affect-rich outcomes. We corroborated this prediction by observing probability -outcomes interactions: An affect-poor prize was preferred over an affect-rich prize under certainty, but the direction of preference reversed under low probability. We suggest that the assumption of probability-outcome independence, adopted by both expected-utility and prospect theory, may hold across outcomes of different monetary values, but not different affective values.

	",22.0,"The widespread popularity and use of both the Poisson and negative binomial models for count data arises, in part, from their derivation as the number of arrivals in a given time period assuming exponenitally distributed interarrival times (without and with heterogeneity in the underlying base rates respectively).  However, with that clean theory comes some limitations including limited flexibility in the assumed underlying arrival rate distribution and the inability to model underdispersed counts (variance less than the mean).  While extant research has addressed some of these issues, there still remain numerous valuable extensions.    
In this research, we present a model that, due to computational tractability, was previously thought to be infeasible. In particular, we introduce here a generalized model for count data based upon an assumed Weibull interarrival process that nests the Poisson and negative binomial models as special cases. The computational intractability is overcome by deriving the Weibull count model using a polynomial expansion which then allows for closed-form inference (integration term-by-term) when incorporating heterogeneity due to the conjugacy of the expansion and a commonly employed gamma distribution.    
In addition, we demonstrate that this new Weibull count model can: (a) sometimes alleviate the need for heterogeneity suggesting that what many think is overdispersion may just be model misfit due to a different and more flexible timing model (Weibull versus exponential), (b) model both over and under dispersed count data, (c) allow covariates to be introduced straightforwardly through the hazard function, and (d) be computed in standard software.  In fact, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using a data analysis run, including bootstrap standard errors computed via a weighted-likelihood, run in Microsoft Excel.

	",13.0,"The pallet is a platform used for storing, handling, and transporting products. There are hundreds of different pallet sizes around the world. Raballand and Aldaz-Carroll examine the case of pallets to illustrate the impact of multiplicity of standards on trade costs. They select this case because pallets are used all around the world, pallet standards are not too sophisticated, and data on the impact of pallet standards are to some extent available. The authors examine why there are so many different pallet sizes, the associated trade costs, and the reasons why countries have not harmonized pallet sizes to eliminate such costs. They then present options for exporters to mitigate the adverse effects of standards multiplicity while complying with destination markets' standard requirements. The range of options is limited in the case of exporters from less developed countries because of the lack of rental and exchange pallet markets. To mitigate the costs of this multiplicity of standards, the World Bank's strategy should be divided in two directions: To develop awareness of costs related to the multiplicity of standards and to support actively harmonization at the global level (within International Organization for Standardization) and at the regional level (within regional cooperation agreements).

However, applying this filter requires a dataset of infinite length.  In practice, some sort of approximation is needed. Using projections, we derive approximations that are optimal when the time series representations underlying the raw data have a unit root, or are stationary about a trend. We identify one approximation which, though it is only optimal for one particular time series representation, nevertheless works well for standard macroeconomic time series. To illustrate the use of this approximation, we use it to characterize the change in the nature of the Phillips curve and the money-inflation relation before and after the 1960s. We find that there is surprisingly little change in the Phillips curve and substantial change in money growth-inflation relation.

	",32.0,"The new frontier of the Fourth Amendment is the search and seizure of computer data. Created to regulate entering homes and seizing physical evidence, the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures is now called on to regulate a very different process: retrieval of digital evidence from electronic storage devices. While obvious analogies exist between searching computers and searching physical spaces, important differences between them will force courts to rethink the basic meaning of the Fourth Amendment's key concepts. What does it mean to search computer data? When is computer data seized? When is a computer search or seizure reasonable?    
This article offers a normative framework for applying the Fourth Amendment to searches of computer data. It begins by exploring the basic differences between physical searches of physical property and electronic searches of digital evidence. It then proposes an exposure theory of Fourth Amendment searches: any exposure of data to an output device such as a monitor should be a search of that data, and only that data. The exposure approach is then matched with a rule for computer seizures: while copying data should not be deemed a seizure of that data, searches of copies should be treated the same as searches of the original. In the final section, the article proposes a rethinking of the plain view exception in computer searches to reflect the new dynamic of digital evidence investigations. The plain view exception should be narrowed or even eliminated in digital evidence cases to ensure that digital warrants that are narrow in theory do not devolve into general warrants in practice. Tailoring the doctrine in light of the new realities of computer investigations will protect the function of existing Fourth Amendment rules in the new world of digital evidence.

	",33.0,"In corporate law scholarship, two basic models have long competed: managerialism and shareholder primacy. Managerialist theories treat the corporation as a bureaucratic hierarchy dominated by professional managers. Shareholder primacy theory formerly argued that shareholders own the corporation and, accordingly, directors and officers are mere stewards of the shareholders' interests. A more recent variant, which arguably is the dominant model in today's scholarship, rejects the idea of ownership as irrelevant to the firm as a nexus of contracts. Yet, shareholders retain a privileged position among the corporation's constituencies, because their contract with the firm has ownership-like features, including the right to vote and the fiduciary obligations of directors and officers.    
The chief criteria for any model of the corporation must be the model's ability to predict the separation of ownership and control, the institutional governance structures following from their separation, and the legal rules responsive to their separation. Shareholders, who are said to own the firm, have virtually no power to control either its day-to-day operation or its long-term policies. Instead, the firm is controlled by its board of directors and subordinate managers, whose equity stake is often small. On close examination, neither managerialism nor shareholder primacy adequately explains the corporate governance features that follow from the separation of ownership and control.    
This article develops an alternative model-director primacy. In this model, the corporation is a vehicle by which the board of directors hires various factors of production. Hence, the board of directors is not a mere agent of the shareholders, but rather is a sui generis body - a sort of Platonic guardian - serving as the nexus for the various contracts making up the corporation. The board's powers flow from that set of contracts in its totality and not just from shareholders. In developing this analysis, the Article uses as its principal foil the so-called ""connected contracts"" model recently put forward by UCLA law professors Gulati, Klein, and Zolt.

	",35.0,"American industrial enterprises long organized their production processes in rigid hierarchies in which production-level employees had little discretion or decision making authority. Recently, however, many firms have adopted participatory management programs purporting to give workers a substantially greater degree of input into corporate decisions. Quality circles, self-directed work teams, and employee representation on the board of directors are probably the best-known examples of this phenomenon.    
These forms of workplace organization have garnered considerable attention from labor lawyers and economists, but relatively little from corporate law academics. This is unfortunate, both because the tools routinely used by corporate law academics have considerable application to the problem and because employee participation is ultimately a question of corporate governance.    
According to conventional academic wisdom, perceptions of procedural justice are important to corporate efficiency. Employee voice promotes a sense of justice, increasing trust and commitment within the enterprise and thus productivity. Workers having a voice in decisions view their tasks as being part of a collaborative effort, rather than as just a job. In turn, this leads to enhanced job satisfaction, which, along with the more flexible work rules often associated with work teams, results in a greater intensity of effort from the firms workers and thus leads to a more efficient firm.    
Although this view of participatory management has become nearly hegemonic, the academic literature nevertheless remains somewhat vague when it comes to explaining just why employee involvement should have these beneficial results. In contrast, my article presents a clear explanation of why some firms find employee involvement enhances productivity and, perhaps even more important, why it fails to do so in some firms. Despite the democratic rhetoric of employee involvement, participatory management in fact has done little to disturb the basic hierarchial structure of large corporations. Instead, it is simply an adaptive response to three significant problems created by the tendency in large firms towards excessive levels of hierarchy. First, large branching hierarchies themselves create informational inefficiencies. Second, informational asymmetries persist even under efficient hierarchial structures. Finally, excessive hierarchy impedes effective monitoring of employees. Participatory management facilitates the flow of information from the production level to senior management by creating a mechanism for by-passing mid-level managers, while also bringing to bear a variety of new pressures designed to deter shirking.

	",25.0,"In the past decade the entertainment industry has waged a legally very successful campaign against online copyright infringements. In a series of high profile decisions, content industries persuaded courts to accept expansive interpretations of contributory enforcement, to create novel doctrines of copyright infringement, and to apply broad interpretations of statutory damage provisions. Many private file-sharers, technology companies, university administrators and Internet service providers have felt the reach of this litigation effort. Yet a significant empirical anomaly exists: even as the copyright industry has ramped up the level of deterrence, online copyright infringements continue unabated.  
Why has the legal battle against file-sharers been so ineffective? The most straightforward explanation is that infringers are not deterred, either because the probability of getting caught remains remote or because the sanctions are not sufficiently salient. If that is the case, the expansive statutory damage award remedies in recent decisions such as Capitol Records v. Thomas-Rasset and Sony BMG v. Tenebaum, carry renewed promise for the entertainment industry.   
In this Article we claim that this deterrence-based approach will prove futile and even counterproductive to the goals of copyright holders. We argue that copyright law faces conditions similar to Prohibition and other historical episodes of enforcement failure. When infringements are widespread, effective deterrence cannot be attained without raising enforcement to levels that undermine the support for the underlying rules. As a result, enforcement has the inadvertent effect of moving behavior in the opposite direction from that intended by the law. In the context of copyright law, enforcement has increased the gap between the social and legal perceptions of copyright law. Because file sharers, as a group, perceive copyright litigation as excessive, this inadvertently strengthens opposition to the legally protected interests of copyright law.   
To further our understanding of the interplay between enforcement and public attitudes, we conduct two empirical studies on norms and copyright law. The results confirm that copyright enforcement is a double-edged sword. While stringent sanctions have a modest deterrent effect on file-sharing behavior, they increase anti-copyright sentiments among frequent offenders. This raises a spectacular challenge for copyright enforcement-the more copyright owners push to step up sanctions for copyright infringements; the more the public resents the protected rights. Consequently, stepping up sanctions tends to increase - rather than decrease - the rate and frequency of infringing activities. Our key results suggest therefore, that more stringent copyright enforcement will further erode respect for copyrights and may prove counterproductive to copyright owners.

	",21.0,"With the introduction of pharmaceutical product patents for the first time (via the 2005 amendments to India's patents act), it is feared that there would be a steep rise in drug prices and a consequential adverse impact on access to important drugs. Civil society proponents argue that the TRIPS flexibilities available were not exploited appropriately and that adequate safeguards were not built in to ensure an affordable supply of medicines. While this concern by civil society has some merit, what it misses is the flexibility that already inheres in the Patent Office to tailor patent protection to suit policy needs. This article argues that the Indian Patent Office has had an interesting history of taking itself to be a policy guardian of sorts and demonstrating a rather conservative approach to the issue of patentability. This policy-style reasoning can be traced back to the Ayyangar Committee report, a document that formed the very basis for the current Indian patent regime. Underlying this report was the clear message that fewer patents resulted in a stronger indigenous industry, particularly in the area of pharmaceuticals and chemicals. This article demonstrates the influence of this policy document on the decisions of the Patent Office even today and posits that, rooted in a system that stressed the virtues of a weak patent system, it is likely that the Patent Office would continue with a conservative approach to the issue of patentability, even with regard to pharmaceutical inventions (that are patentable under the 2005 Act).

	",,"This essay interprets the legal history of efforts to prohibit intermarriage between Filipino men and white women in the state of California in the 1920s and 30s. I do this through examining both public discourse and legal discourse, in the form of advisory opinions of the California State Attorney General and the Los Angeles County Counsel, litigation in Los Angles Superior Court and the California Court of Appeals, and state legislation.    
Much scholarship examines antimiscegenation laws through the lens of presumptive heterosexuality, and gives enormous explanatory power to race in a way that ignores the role of class and gender. This paper argues that we need to examine the mutually constitutive nature of these forces in shaping antimiscegenation laws. Thus, I examine how the racial identity of Filipinos was shaped by assumptions about racialized sexuality, colonial relations between the United States and the Philippines, the importation of exploitable laborers without political rights, and the intertwining of gender and nationalism.    
The question of whether Filipinos should be prohibited from marrying white women reached the California Court of Appeals in 1933 in the guise of the query as to whether Filipinos should be considered ""Mongolian."" The state in 1880 and 1905 had prohibited the licensing of marriages between ""Mongolians"" and ""white persons"" and invalidated all such marriages. Subsequent legal challenges involving the right of Filipinos to marry whites betray enormous confusion as to whether Filipinos should be classified as ""Mongolian,"" or as a separate ethnological group, as ""Malay."" This racial classification was put at issue in cases where Filipino/white couples sought to marry, and who therefore asserted that Filipinos were not ""Mongolians""; in a case where a mother sought to stop her daughter's marriage; in two cases where annulment of marriage was sought, one by a white woman, the other by a Filipino man; and in one case in which a prosecutor sought to void a marriage so a white wife could testify against her Filipino husband.    
The positioning of Filipinos as ""Mongolian,"" or in opposition to ""Mongolians"" as the ethnologically different ""Malay,"" provides a narrative within which the contemporary identity of Filipinos is created. This history demonstrates that there is nothing natural or preordained about racial classification, and provides an example of how race is made.

	",9.0,"In a corporate freeze-out, the controller is required to compensate minority shareholders for the no-freezeout value of their shares that are taken from them.  This paper seeks to highlight the difficulties involved in determining this no-freezeout value when, as is often the case, the controller has private information.  In particular, the analysis shows that the pre-freezeout market price of minority shares cannot be used as a proxy for the no-freezeout value that these shares would have in the absence of a freeze-out. It is shown that, under a regime in which frozen out minority shareholders receive a compensation equal to the pre-freezeout market price, the pre-freezeout market price will be set at a level below the expected no-freezeout value of minority shares.  The reason for this is a ""lemons effect"" that arises when a controller uses her private information in deciding whether to effect a freeze-out.  By showing how controllers are able to use their private information to effect freeze-outs at terms favorable to them, this paper demonstrates that freeze-outs can become a significant source for private benefits of control.

	",74.0,"Economic analysis demonstrates that, continuing from its intentionally racist beginnings in the 1920s, the American Bar Association's system for accrediting law schools excludes most African-Americans from the legal profession, while allowing whites to enter.  The discriminatory impact of ABA accreditation takes two forms.  First, the ABA accreditation standards inflict academic racism.  The standards impose academic requirements that African-Americans tend to lack, eliminating most schools that would serve average African-Americans.  For example, the ABA generally denies accreditation to any school for which the average LSAT score is below 143.  The average LSAT score for African-Americans is 142, compared to 152 for whites.  The ABA's requirements of high undergraduate grades and high bar-pass rates are similarly discriminatory.    
Second, ABA accreditation imposes financial racism.  The accreditation requirements cause law schools' costs and tuition levels to more than double.  Because African-Americans have far lower average incomes than whites, the requirements make law school affordable only for whites, not for most African-Americans.    
Affirmative action and the availability of student loans counteract only a small part of the accreditation system's discriminatory impacts.  Elimination of both accreditation and the bar exam would integrate the profession and provide many other benefits, while producing few harms.

	",69.0,"Americans believe that undocumented immigrants are exploiting the United States' economy. The widespread belief is that illegal aliens cost more in government services than they contribute to the economy. This belief is undeniably false. [E]very empirical study of illegals' economic impact demonstrates the opposite . . .: undocumenteds actually contribute more to public coffers in taxes than they cost in social services.  Moreover, undocumented immigrants contribute to the U.S. economy through their investments and consumption of goods and services; filling of millions of essential worker positions resulting in subsidiary job creation, increased productivity and lower costs of goods and services; and unrequited contributions to Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance programs. Eighty-five percent of eminent economists surveyed have concluded that undocumented immigrants have had a positive (seventy-four percent) or neutral (eleven percent) impact on the U.S. economy.     
Undocumented immigrants, like all U.S. citizens and residents, are required to pay taxes. Despite the historic and strong American opposition to taxation without representation, undocumented immigrants (except in rare and unusual cases) have not enjoyed the right to vote on any local, state or federal tax or other matter for almost eighty years.  Nevertheless, each year undocumented immigrants add billions of dollars in sales, excise, property, income and payroll taxes, including Social Security, Medicare and unemployment taxes, to federal, state and local coffers. Hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants go out of their way to file annual federal and state income tax returns.     
Yet undocumented immigrants are barred from almost all government benefits, including food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid, federal housing programs, Supplemental Security Income, Unemployment Insurance, Social Security, Medicare, and the earned income tax credit (EITC). Generally, the only benefits federally required for undocumented immigrants are emergency medical care, subject to financial and category eligibility, and elementary and secondary public education. Many undocumented immigrants will not even access these few critical government services because of their ever-present fear of government officials and deportation.    
Undocumented immigrants living in the United States are subject to the same income tax laws as documented immigrants and U.S. citizens.  However, because of their status most unauthorized workers pay a higher effective tax rate than similarly situated documented or U.S. citizens.  Yet, these workers and their families use fewer government services than similarly situated documented immigrants or U.S. citizens.  Moreover, unauthorized workers have been denied remedies by the U.S. Supreme Court under the National Labor Relations Act and may be challenged to receive protection under wage and hour, anti-discrimination and workers' compensation laws. As a result, undocumented immigrants provide a fiscal windfall and may be the most fiscally beneficial of all immigrants.    
Despite their net positive contribution to public coffers, hundreds of thousands of immigrants enter the U.S. each year without documents because of impracticable quota and labor certification requirements.  These immigration restrictions combined with the additional tax or tariff on undocumented immigrants are inconsistent with economically efficient immigration policy.  Moreover, the high effective tax rate imposed on the poorest undocumented working families relative to their less unfortunate friends and neighbors is inconsistent with fundamental tax policy.  This Article describes and analyzes the separate, unequal and unrepresented federal taxation of undocumented immigrants.

	",21.0,"Texas Republicans have been thinking waaaaay too small. The redistricting battles of 2003-2004 are nothing compared to the powerful political potential posed by Texas's prerogative, confererred by an Act of Congress, to divide itself into five states. A relatively obscure provision of the 1845 Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas to the United States provides that [n]ew States, of convenient size, not exceeding four in number, in addition to said State of Texas, and having sufficient population, may hereafter by the consent of said State, be formed out of the territory thereof, which shall be entitled to admission under the provisions of the federal constitution. This Essay argues, building on our earlier work concerning the constitutionality of the creation of West Virginia, that Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution permits new states to be carved out of existing ones, with the consent of Congress and the states involved. The New States language of the 1845 Joint Resolution, the Texas Tots provision, constitutes the still-operative, legally-valid grant of Congress's consent to Texas's subdivision into five states. All that remains is for Texas to take up Congress's standing offer.

	",10.0,"Ought implies can. This paper investigates whether the central moral directives of liberalism are ones citizens can - as matter of human cognition - be expected to honor. Liberalism obliges the state to disclaim a moral orthodoxy and instead premise legal obligation on secular grounds accessible to persons of diverse cultural persuasions. Studies of the phenomenon of cultural cognition, however, suggest that individuals naturally impute socially harmful consequences to behavior that defies their moral norms. As a result, they are impelled to suppress morally deviant behavior even when they honestly perceive themselves to be motivated only by the secular good of harm prevention. The paper identifies how this dynamic transforms seemingly instrumental debates over environmental regulation, public health, economic policy, and crime control into polarizing forms of illiberal status competition. It also proposes a counterintuitive remedy: rather than attempt to cleanse the law of culturally partisan meanings - the discourse strategy associated with the liberal norm of public reason - lawmakers should endeavor to infuse it with a surfeit of meanings capable of affirming a wide range of competing worldviews simultaneously.

	",57.0,"This article is the first major work of legal scholarship on systemic risk, under which the world's financial system can collapse like a row of dominos. There is widespread confusion about the causes and even the definition of systemic risk, and uncertainty how to control it. This article attempts to provide a conceptual framework for examining what risks are truly systemic, what causes those risks, and how, if at all, those risks should be regulated.    
It begins by carefully examining what systemic risk really means, cutting through the confusion and ambiguity to establish basic parameters. Economists and other scholars historically have tended to think of systemic risk primarily in terms of financial institutions such as banks. However with the growth of disintermediation, in which companies can access capital market funding without going through banks or other intermediary-institutions, greater focus should be devoted to financial markets and the relationship between markets and institutions.     
Using this integrated perspective, the article derives a working definition of systemic risk. It then uses this definition to examine whether systemic risk should be regulated. To that end, the article examines how risk itself - in particular, financial risk - should be regulated and then inquires how that regulatory framework should change by reason of the financial risk being systemic.     
A threshold question is whether regulatory solutions are appropriate for systemic risk. The article argues they are because, like a tragedy of the commons, no individual market participant has an incentive, absent regulation, to limit its risk taking in order to reduce the systemic danger to other participants and third parties.

	",12.0,"This paper examines two fundamentally different perspectives when nation-states participate as creditors and debtors. The issue of sovereign debt - its character and effect - is really part of the much larger battle between two fundamentally opposed visions of the nature and character of the nation-states in general, and debtor states in particular, and of the global system that maintains the market for such transactions.  The dominant vision, firmly grounded in private law, posits that growth can occur only in a tightly integrated global economy founded on trade liberalization, privatization, and macrostability. When the state fails to pay its debts, it ought to be treated like any other failed corporate enterprise - a stay on debt collection efforts, broad enforcement of absolute priority, creditor approval of the proposed reorganization plan, and well protected new interim financing pending restructuring. Opposing the dominant vision is an anti-corporatist approach grounded in public law and the subordination of economics and markets to political control in the furtherance of deliberate state public policy and planning.  States fail because it is in the interest of dominant states to use sovereign debt as a means of perpetuating subordination and a hierarchy of power among states.  When a state fails to pay its debts, the focus ought to be on the creditor, and the fairness of the debt in terms of the larger public policy concerns - development, and the maximization of living standards for all individuals through state planning.  The paper first explores the normative foundations of each vision and its consequences for dealing with the borrowings of nation-states.  For this purpose the paper concentrates on two actors who most starkly highlight the opposing views.  For the dominant vision is focus is on Anne Krueger, the First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, and specifically on her proposal to create a bankruptcy model for sovereign state debt restructuring.  For the opposing vision the focus is on Fidel Castro Ruz, the President of the Republic of Cuba and specifically on his elaboration of a critique of the dominant vision of global economic development championed by the IMF. These actors nicely distill the positions subject to analysis in this paper.  The implications of each for the shape and character of international regulation, and of the state as an actor in the context of the emerging global system of economic and political regulation, are then explored.  In particular, the paper contextualizes the Castro vision within the developing positions of a number of public sector institutions, from Latin American opposition ot the Free Trade Area of the Americas, to its use by the United Nations Human Rights establishment in Geneva to regulate transnational corporations, to its use by non-state actors in the West, particularly the Roman Catholic Church, to challenge, from within the West, the market driven system elaborated through the IMF and well illustrated by Krueger's proposal for a corporate bankruptcy style state discipline overseen by international regulatory agencies.

	",,"Competitive maneuvering in the information economy has raised a pressing question: how can firms raise profits by giving away products for free? This paper provides a possible answer and articulates a strategy space for information product design. Free strategic complements can raise a firm's own profits while free strategic substitutes can lower profits for competitors.  
We introduce a formal model of two-sided market externalities based in textbook economics -- a mix of Katz & Shapiro network effects, price discrimination, and product differentiation -- that leads to novel strategies such as an eagerness to enter into Bertrand price competition. This combination helps to explain many recent firm strategies such as those of Microsoft, Netscape (AOL), Sun, Adobe, and ID.  
The model presented here argues for three simple and intuitive results. First, a firm can rationally invest in a product it intends to give away into perpetuity even in the absence of competition. Second, we identify distinct markets for content-providers and end-consumers and show that either can be a candidate for the free good. Third, a firm can use strategic product design to penetrate a market that becomes competitive post-entry. The model therefore helps to explain several interesting market behaviors such as free goods, upgrade paths, split versioning, and strategic information substitutes.

	",,"Since the 1970s the federal government has been involved in the regulation of wetlands under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Like most federal environmental programs, authority for this regulation is premised upon an expansive reading of the Commerce Clause.  In 1995, however, the Supreme Court suggested that Congress' Commerce Clause power is limited, raising questions about the constitutional limits of federal environmental regulation.  This article analyzes the Commerce Clause doctrines explicit and implicit in United States v. Lopez and the extent to which this decision should limit federal wetlands regulation.  The article continues to question whether judicially enforced limits on federal regulatory authority will compromise wetland conservation efforts.  Based upon a review of the theoretical literature and empirical evidence, the article concludes that limiting the federal government's ability to regulate wetlands need not undermine conservation efforts, and there is substantial reason to believe that reimposing constitutional limits on federal regulatory authority may well improve environmental protection efforts.

	",257.0,"The most famous case in administrative law, Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., has come to be seen as a counter-Marbury, or even a McCulloch v. Maryland, for the administrative state. But in the last period, new debates have broken out over Chevron Step Zero - the initial inquiry into whether Chevron applies at all. These debates are the contemporary location of a longstanding dispute between Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer over whether Chevron is a revolutionary decision, establishing an across-the-board rule, or instead a mere synthesis of preexisting law, inviting a case-by-case inquiry into congressional instructions on the deference question. In the last decade, Justice Breyer's case-by-case view has enjoyed significant victories. Two trilogies of cases - one explicitly directed to the Step Zero question, another implicitly so directed - suggest that the Chevron framework may not apply (a) to agency decisions not preceded by formal procedures and (b) to agency decisions that involve large-scale questions about agency authority. Both of these trilogies threaten to unsettle the Chevron framework, and to do so in a way that produces unnecessary complexity for judicial review and damaging results for regulatory law. These problems can be reduced through two steps. First, courts should adopt a broader understanding of Chevron's scope. Second, courts should acknowledge that the argument for Chevron deference is strengthened, not weakened, when major questions of statutory structure are involved. "," Chevron U.S.A. v.

Using a data set of French Impressionist paintings brought to auction from 1985 to 2001, we control for the effect of works that are bought in-house to construct a distribution of potential sale values that corrects for sample selection bias.  It turns out that the downside risk surrounding deviations of auction prices from expert presale estimates depends criticall on how buy-ins are incorporated.  If downside risk is assessed solely on historical experience with successful auction sales, the data appear to support loan-to-value ratios between fifty and a hundred percent larger than loan-to-value ratios that countenance the existence of seller reserves.

	",59.0,"The growth and development of a major Japanese export - comics and related products, including animated cartoons and so-called ""character goods"" such as trading cards, lunchboxes, etc. - has occurred simultaneously with the development of very large, openly-held markets for what would appear to be books and products that infringe copyrightholders' interest in these well-known characters.  While many infringers are judgment-proof small timers, those who operate the markets and bookstores that trade these wares are often for-profit and even publicly-traded corporations.   Although actions for both infringement and contributory infringement are clearly winnable under existing Japanese law, up until now they have been rare.  It appears that for a variety of reasons - such as reputational consequences and relatively low (reasonable royalty) damage awards - it is not economically rational to bring these suits.  Interestingly, many observers believe that the vibrancy of these markets for infringement has created numerous innovations and fostered the emergence of talented artists who have benefitted the industry as a whole.  The relatively weak legal regime in Japan, noted widely elsewhere, appears to have by chance solved a collective action problem and prevented the interests of a few copyrightholders from inhibiting the growth and development of the industry as a whole.

	",39.0,"The growth in the trade share of output is one of the most important features of the world economy since World War II.  The growth is generally thought to have been generated by falling tariff barriers worldwide.  This thinking, however, does not square with standard static and dynamic international trade models.  Because tariff barriers have decreased little since the early 1960s, these models cannot explain the growth of trade without assuming counterfactually large elasticities of substitution between domestic and foreign goods.  I show that this growth can be reconciled with the relatively small declines in tariffs once vertical specialization is included in the models.  Vertical specialization, which occurs when countries specialize only in particular stages of a good's production sequence, magnifies the trade growth effects of trade barrier reduction.  To show this, I calibrate and simulate a dynamic Ricardian model of trade with vertical specialization.  I show that this model can explain about 70 percent of the growth of trade with just a unitary elasticity of substitution.  The model also has important implications for the gains from trade.

I develop and estimate a two-period model that allows for heterogeneous forms of simultaneous adverse selection and moral hazard. Controlling for income levels, loan size and risk aversion, I find robust evidence of adverse selection, with borrowers self-selecting into contracts with varying interest rates and collateral requirements. For example, ex-post higher-risk borrowers pledge less collateral and pay higher interest rates. Moreover, there is strongly suggestive evidence of moral hazard such that collateral is used to induce a borrower's effort to avoid repayment problems. Thus, loan terms may have a feedback effect on behavior. Also, higher-risk borrowers are more difficult to induce into exerting effort, explaining the counter-intuitive result that higher-risk borrowers sometimes pay lower interest rates than observably lower-risk borrowers.

	",14.0,"In December 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a rule for mercury emissions from power plants and issued a final rule for mercury emissions from chlor-alkali facilities. Regarding power plants, EPA had previously found that mercury posed the most serious threat among the hazardous air pollutants emitted by power plants, and also that regulation of mercury from power plants was appropriate and necessary under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, which requires stringent technology-based regulation for hazardous air pollutants. Despite section 112's clear rejection of emissions trading as a compliance option, EPA has proposed to allow commercial trading in this highly toxic substance. In addressing mercury from chlor-alkali plants, EPA admitted that approximately 65 tons of mercury from these plants (more than the total emitted by U.S. power plants) are unaccounted for, and allowed the plants using the most antiquated technology to continue to do so indefinitely. The first of a two-part series, this article canvases the science and law on mercury emissions, and finds that EPA's decisions are deeply defective in both realms. The next installment will examine the agency's decisions from the perspective of economics and environmental justice.

	",35.0,"A Monte Carlo method is presented to study the effect of systematic and random errors on computer models mainly dealing with experimental data. It is a common assumption in this type of models (linear and nonlinear regression, and nonregression computer models) involving experimental measurements that the error sources are mainly random and independent with no constant background errors (systematic errors). However, from comparisons of different experimental data sources evidence is often found of significant bias or calibration errors. The uncertainty analysis approach presented in this work is based on the analysis of cumulative probability distributions for output variables of the models involved taking into account the effect of both types of errors. The probability distributions are obtained by performing Monte Carlo simulation coupled with appropriate definitions for the random and systematic errors. The main objectives are to detect the error source with stochastic dominance on the uncertainty propagation and the combined effect on output variables of the models. The results from the case studies analyzed show that the approach is able to distinguish which error type has a more significant effect on the performance of the model. Also, it was found that systematic or calibration errors, if present, cannot be neglected in uncertainty analysis of models dependent on experimental measurements such as chemical and physical properties. The approach can be used to facilitate decision making in fields related to safety factors selection, modeling, experimental data measurement, and experimental design.

	",,"Economic analysis of law usually proceeds with the behavioral assumptions of neoclassical economics.  But empirical evidence gives us much reason to doubt these assumptions; people are boundedly rational and boundedly self-interested, and they have bounded willpower.  The result is to call into question many of the predictions and prescriptions offered by traditional law and economics .In this paper we offer a broad vision of how law and economics analysis may be improved by increased attention to insights about actual human behavior.  Our analysis divides into three categories:  positive, prescriptive, and normative.  Positive analysis of law concerns how agents behave in response to legal rules and how legal rules are produced; here we suggest that in many areas, a behavioral approach improves predictions about both the effects and content of law. Prescriptive analysis concerns what rules should be adopted to advance specified ends; here we offer alternatives (in areas including informational disclosure and criminal law) to standard law and economics prescriptions based on behavioral insights.  Finally, normative analysis attempts to assess more broadly the ends of the legal system:  Should the system always respect people's choices?  What is the appropriate domain of paternalism?  By drawing attention to cognitive and motivational problems, behavioral law and economics offers answers distinct from those offered by the standard analysis.  In addressing many specific topics in law, we attempt to provide some answers, and also to outline an extended research agenda for future work in behavioral law and economics.

	",70.0,"What dynamics shape public risk perceptions? What significance should such perceptions have in the formation of risk regulation? In Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle (2005), Cass Sunstein catalogs a variety of cognitive and social mechanisms that he argues inflate public estimations of various societal risks. To counter the impact of irrational public fears, he advocates delegation of authority to politically insulated experts using economic cost-benefit analysis. Missing from Sunstein's impressive account, however, is any attention to the impact of cultural cognition, the tendency of individuals to form risk perceptions that reflect and reinforce their cultural worldviews. Relying on existing and original empirical research, we use this dynamic to develop an alternative cultural evaluator model, which better explains individual variation in risk perception, differences of opinions among experts, and the intensity of political conflict over risk than does Sunstein's irrational weigher model. Cultural cognition also complicates Sunstein's policy prescriptions. Because the public fears that Sunstein describes as irrational express cultural values, expert cost-benefit analysis does not merely insulate the law from factual error, as Sunstein argues; rather, it systematically detaches law from popular understandings of the ideal society. Indeed, the best defense of Sunstein's program might be just that: by eliding the role that risk regulation plays in endorsing contested cultural visions, expert cost-benefit analysis protects the law from a divisive and deeply illiberal form of expressive politics. The difficult task for those who understand the phenomenon of cultural cognition and who favor democratic modes of policymaking is to devise procedures that assure that popularly responsive risk regulation is both rational and respectful of diverse cultural worldviews.

	",13.0,"More than one quarter of all states have toughened bar exam standards in recent years, with other states poised to follow suit.  About one-third of exam takers from ABA-accredited schools now fail the bar exam on the first attempt.  Many of these students would have passed the bar five years ago, before states started raising their passing scores.         These higher passing scores raise important policy issues about competition, diversity, and access in the legal profession.  In many states, moreover, the new scores rest on a flawed statistical process.  Bar examiners, unaware of these defects, are setting arbitrary passing scores that most likely exclude qualified applicants.         This article explores both the policy issues surrounding recent increases to bar passing scores and the methodological defects in the statistical process used to set those scores.  The analyses are important, not only for assuring fair access to the legal profession, but as a case study of the ways in which flawed statistical processes can affect policy outcomes.

	",118.0,Financial regulators in many states recently have obtained statutory mandates to enhance consumer financial literacy. This paper investigates the development of policy pursuant to such mandates in the UK and Canada to identify how national regulators represent the role of the literate consumer in the financial market place. It finds that regulators in both countries represent financial education as empowering consumers but that each embeds in its policy an implicit normative ordering of responsible consumer behavior. The paper relates the tension between empowerment and responsibilization aspects of literacy enhancement to policy goals of expanding financial markets and assisting financial regulators to manage consumers' expectations of protection. It raises questions about regulators' use of consumer education to responsibilize consumption of financial products and calls for further research on the international growth of financial literacy education as a regulatory project. ,,https://ssrn.com/abstract=972551http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9930.2007.00254.x ,https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/Announcements-Jobs/,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=972551,"Behavioral & Experimental Finance eJournal,Wiley-Blackwell: Law & Policy,Household Finance eJournal,Financial Literacy eJournal,Household Financial Planning eJournal","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=1504395,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=306435,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=1552954,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=2357013,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=3473260",,145,303,3,0,0

	",15.0,"In this paper, I provide evidence that currency stop-loss orders contribute to rapid, self-reinforcing price movements, or price cascades. Stop-loss orders, which instruct a dealer to buy (sell) a certain amount of currency at the market rate once the rate has risen (fallen) to a prespecified level, generate positive-feedback trading. Theoretical research on the 1987 stock market crash suggests that such trading can cause price discontinuities, which would manifest themselves as price cascades.    
My analysis of high-frequency exchange rates offers three main results that provide empirical support for the hypothesis that stop-loss orders contribute to price cascades: (1) Exchange rate trends are unusually rapid when rates reach exchange rate levels at which stop-loss order have been documented to cluster. (2) The response to stop-loss orders is larger than the response to take-profit orders, which generate negative-feedback trading and are therefore unlikely to contribute to price cascades. (3) The response to stop-loss orders lasts longer than the response to take-profit orders. Most results are statistically significant for hours, although not for days. Together, these results indicate that stop-loss orders propagate trends and are sometimes triggered in waves, contributing to price cascades. Stop-loss propagated price cascades may help explain the well-known fat tails of the distribution of exchange rate returns, or equivalently the high frequency of large exchange rate moves. The paper also provides evidence that exchange rates respond to noninformative order flow.

We derive a long-run Taylor principle that delivers unique bounded equilibria in two standard models. Policy can satisfy the Taylor principle in the long run, even while deviating from it substantially for brief periods or modestly for prolonged periods. Macroeconomic volatility can be higher in periods when the Taylor principle is not satisfied, not because of indeterminacy, but because monetary policy amplifies the impacts of fundamental shocks.

	",24.0,"In this article we examine the use of business documents to prove antitrust violations. Such usage has long occurred in the courts and regulatory agencies. More recently, there has been a scholarly effort to justify the use of such documents and the rhetoric they contain in antitrust analysis. But despite this usage and in the face of this justification, we demonstrate that business documents provide a faulty foundation for proving economic injury under the antitrust laws.     
We identify three classes of business documents that are used by courts and regulators in antitrust analysis: Accounting documents, market definition documents, and intent documents. We conclude that each is problematic. Accounting information is sufficiently disconnected from underlying economic reality that it presents a distorted and unreliable picture of economic consequences. Businesses characterize markets for myriad reasons, most having nothing to do with elasticity, the criterion of market definition relevant to the antitrust laws. Likewise, corporate actors express intentions and motivations for rhetorical purposes, not necessarily because they possess the capacity to achieve their ""intended"" effect.       
While it is beyond dispute that antitrust adjudication is difficult, we show that the regulatory and scholarly effort to bring business documents to bear in proving antitrust cases has a ""the light's better over here"" feel to it. It is undoubtedly easier to ""discover"" anticompetitive behavior and relevant markets by inferences from business language than it is from rigorous economic analysis. Not only regulators but also courts (to say nothing of juries) are moved by business rhetoric.  However, we contend that business rhetoric bears little relationship to economic reality. Corporate managers are not, generally, economists; nor are they antitrust lawyers. Accounting, accountability, personal incentives and other concerns that do not relate in an obvious way to the maximization of the firm's profits influence the daily operation of business - and the language of business - far more than do underlying economic and legal concepts. Reliance by courts and regulators on accounting information, business characterizations and expressions of intent to demonstrate anticompetitive effect is thus misplaced. The likelihood of error resulting from the use of business documents is substantial. For these reasons, principled antitrust enforcement must rely on evidence of actual economic effect, rather than flawed perceptions of business conduct.

	",50.0,"This paper defines four basic business models based on what asset rights are sold (Creators, Distributors, Landlords and Brokers) and four variations of each based on what type of assets are involved (Financial, Physical, Intangible, and Human). Using this framework, we classified the business models of all 10,970 publicly traded firms in the US economy from 1998 through 2002. Some of these classifications were done manually, based on the firms' descriptions of sources of revenue in their financial reports; the rest were done automatically by a rule-based system using the same data. Based on this analysis, we first document important stylized facts about the distribution of business models in the U.S. economy. Then we analyze the firms' financial performance in three categories: market value, profitability, and operating efficiency. We find that no model outperforms others on all dimensions. Surprisingly, however, we find that some models do, indeed, have better financial performance than others. For instance, Physical Creators (which we call Manufacturers) and Physical Landlords have greater cash flow on assets, and Intellectual Landlords have poorer q's, than Physical Distributors (Wholesaler/Retailers). These findings are robust to a large number of robustness checks and alternative interpretations. We conclude with some hypotheses to explain our findings.

	",,"In the year 1870, the United States Senate conducted a three-day debate on the question of whether an African American man was eligible to sit as a senator.  The major argument against his eligibility was that he had not been a citizen of the United States for nine years, as is required of Senators under Article I, Section 3.  The reasoning was as follows: under Dred Scott v. Sandford, a black man could not be an American citizen.  The Fourteenth Amendment rejected Dred Scott and established universal birthright citizenship, but it was ratified only in 1868.  Accordingly, as of 1870, the would-be black senator had been a citizen for only two years.    
The Senate's debate was major national news in its own day but has been completely forgotten in constitutional history.  This Article recovers the debate and uses it to shed new light on central questions of constitutional law, including (1) whether the Civil War should be understood as a constitutional regime change or as a less far-reaching reform; (2) the relative roles of Court and Congress in constitutional interpretation; (3) the problems of transitional justice that arise when a racially exclusive constitutional system enfranchises members of another racial group but does so on terms set only by the initial insider group; and (4) the process by which some historical episodes rather than others come to shape our conception of constitutional history.

	",,"Michael Klarman's From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality is an important contribution to the scholarly literature on both the history of the civil rights struggle and judicial power more generally. Klarman argues that for much of the twentieth century, the Supreme Court was very reluctant to rule in favor of African American civil rights claimants, and had little impact when it did.  
Klarman is right to reject traditional accounts that greatly exaggerated the Supreme Court's willingness and ability to protect minorities. However, he overstates his case. The Court's views on the proper scope of African Americans' rights periodically diverged from that of the political branches of government. The Justices' relative insulation from political pressure; their membership in a different generational cohort than the median voter; the idiosyncrasies of presidential selection of Justices; and the Justices' nationalist inclinations all help explain this result.  
Moreover, in at least three types of situations, judicial invalidation of Jim Crow legislation significantly aided African Americans: (1) when such legislation had solved collective action problems among racist whites; (2) when legislation had enabled white actors to externalize the costs of Jim Crow onto society as a whole; and (3) when laws lowered the overall costs of maintaining Jim Crow.  
This Review supports these conclusions by closely examining relevant Supreme Court decisions in their historical context, especially Progressive Era cases and Brown v. Board of Education.

	",17.0,"The founders of the United States considered intellectual property worthy of a special place in the Constitution - ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."" In today's knowledge-based economy, capturing value from intellectual capital and knowledge-based assets has gained even more importance. Global competition is no longer for the control of raw materials, but for this productive knowledge.    
This paper is the third in a series of studies focusing on immigrants' contributions to the competitiveness of the U.S. economy. Earlier research revealed a dramatic increase in the contributions of foreign nationals to U.S. intellectual property over an eight-year period. In this paper, we offer a more refined measure of this change and seek to explain this increase with an analysis of the immigrant-visa backlog for skilled workers. The key finding from this research is that the number of skilled workers waiting for visas is significantly larger than the number that can be admitted to the United States. This imbalance creates the potential for a sizeable reverse brain-drain from the United States to the skilled workers' home countries.

The Essay begins with Judge Wisdom celebrating his forty-ninth birthday on May 17, 1954. On that same day, nearly a thousand miles away, the United States Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The decision would have a remarkable impact on New Orleans and the South and affect Judge Wisdom in ways that were perhaps unknowable on that warm, pre-summer evening.    
The Essay recounts the remarkable role Judge Wisdom played in implementing the Brown decision in states encompassed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The author catalogues the recalcitrance with which the South received the decision and the remarkable challenges Judge Wisdom and his peers faced in enforcing Brown's mandate. In doing so, the author provides rich analysis and discussion of Judge Wisdom's most important desegregation cases.

Using archival data on draft-day trades, player performance and compensation, we compare the market value of draft picks with the surplus value to teams provided by the drafted players.

	",,"This paper describes a method of extracting the risk-neutral probability distribution of future exchange rates from option prices. In foreign exchange markets interbank option pricing conventions make possible reliable inferences about risk-neutral probability distributions with relatively little data. Moments drawn from risk-neutral exchange rate distribution are used to explore several issues related to the puzzle of excess returns in currency markets. Tests of the international capital asset pricing model using risk-neutral moments as explanatory variables indicate that option-based moments have considerably greater explanatory power for excess returns in currency markets than has been found in earlier work. Tests of several hypotheses generated by the peso problem approach indicate that jump risk measured by the risk-neutral coefficient of skewness can explain only a small part of the forward bias. These tests take into account not only the second, but the third and fourth moments of the exchange rate implied by option prices, and avoid testing a joint hypothesis including a distributional assumption.

	",6.0,"Risk-neutral valuation is simple, elegant and central in option pricing theory. However, in teaching risk-neutral valuation, it is not easy to explain the concept of 'risk-neutral' probabilities. Beginners who are new to risk-neutral valuation always have lingering doubts about the validity of the probabilities. What do the probabilities really mean? Are they real or fictional? Where do they come from? What is the relationship between the risk-neutral probabilities and the actual probabilities? Does it mean that all investors are risk-neutral? When is it appropriate to use the risk-free rate as the discount rate?    
From a pedagogical point of view, in the beginning it is best to avoid the use of probabilities because probabilities can be a barrier to understanding. Instead, it is far preferable to introduce the idea of state prices and then show that the approach with risk-neutral probabilities is equivalent to the use of state prices.    
In this teaching note, we use simple one-period examples to explain the intuitive ideas behind risk-neutral valuation. It is a gentle introduction to risk-neutral valuation, with a minimum requirement of mathematics and prior knowledge. We will provide the motivation and the rationale for calculating state prices and we will show that the risk-neutral approach is simply another way of looking at the issue of state prices.

The defendant-petitioners presented both of these arguments-the almost arbitrary power over any driver inherent in the ""could have"" approach, and the racially biased use of traffic stops-to the Court. Yet the Court paid little attention to these obvious implications of its decision. Whren is more than a missed opportunity for the Court to rein in some police practices that strike at the heart of the ideas of freedom and equal treatment; Whren represents a clear step in the other direction-toward authoritarianism, toward racist policing, and toward a view of minorities as criminals, rather than citizens.

	",87.0,"Several million people currently have accounts in massively multi-player online games, places in cyberspace that are effectively large-scale shared virtual reality environments. The population of these virtual worlds has grown rapidly since their inception in 1996; significantly, each world also seems to grow its own economy, with production, assets, and trade with Earth economies. This paper explores two questions about these developments. First, will these economies grow in importance? Second, if they do grow, how will that affect real-world economies and governments? To shed light on the first question, the paper presents a brief history of these games along with a simple choice model of the demand for game time. The history suggests that the desire to live in a game world is deep-rooted and driven by game technology. The model reveals a certain puzzle about puzzles and games: in the demand for these kinds of interactive entertainment goods, people reveal that they are willing to pay money to be constrained. Still, the nature of games as a produced good suggests that technological advances, and heavy competition, will drive the future development of virtual worlds. If virtual worlds do become a large part of the daily life of humans, their development may have an impact on the macroeconomies of Earth. It will also raise certain constitutional issues, since it is not clear, today, exactly   who has jurisdiction over these new economies.

	",20.0,"Accusations of political bias in the media are often made by members of both political parties, yet there have been few systematic studies of such bias to date. This paper develops an econometric technique to test for political bias in news reports that controls for the underlying character of the news reported. Our results suggest that American newspapers tend to give more positive news coverage to the same economic news when Democrats are in the Presidency than for Republicans. When all types of news are pooled into a single analysis, our results are highly significant. However, the results vary greatly depending upon which economic numbers are being reported. When GDP growth is reported, Republicans received between 16 and 24 percentage point fewer positive stories for the same economic numbers than Democrats. For durable goods for all newspapers, Republicans received between 15 and 25 percentage points fewer positive news stories than Democrats. For unemployment, the difference was between zero and 21 percentage points. Retail sales showed no difference. Among the Associated Press and the top 10 papers, the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Associated Press, and New York Times tend to be the least likely to report positive news during Republican administrations, while the Houston Chronicle slightly favors Republicans. Only one newspaper treated one Republican administration significantly more positively than the Clinton administration: the Los Angeles Times' headlines were most favorable to the Reagan administration, but it still favored Clinton over either Bush administration. We also find that the media coverage affects people's perceptions of the economy. Contrary to the typical impression that bad news sells, we find that good economic news generates more news coverage and that it is usually covered more prominently. We also present some evidence that media treats parties differently when they control both the presidency and the congress.

	",27.0,"In this paper I derive a risk-adjusted measure of portfolio performance (now known as Jensen's Alpha) that estimates how much a manager's forecasting ability contributes to the fund's returns. The measure is based on the theory of the pricing of capital assets by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965a) and Treynor (Undated). I apply the measure to estimate the predictive ability of 115 mutual fund managers in the period 1945-1964 - that is their ability to earn returns which are higher than those we would expect given the level of risk of each of the portfolios. The foundations of the model and the properties of the performance measure suggested here are discussed in Section II.    
The evidence on mutual fund performance indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buy-the-market-and-hold policy, but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance. It is also important to note that these conclusions hold even when we measure the fund returns gross of management expenses (that is assume their bookkeeping, research, and other expenses except brokerage commissions were obtained free). Thus on average the funds apparently were not quite successful enough in their trading activities to recoup even their brokerage expenses.

	",5.0,"This paper takes up the political theory sketched by the infamous (and now withdrawn) Office of Legal Counsel memorandum of August 1, 2002.  That memorandum proposed for the Bush Administration a theory of executive emergency powers, including the power to use torturous interrogation techniques otherwise barred by domestic and international law.  According to the memorandum, both the power to deploy torture and other forms of coercive interrogation, and the general freedom of the executive to direct policy in times of war, are grounded in a justification of necessity.  The central aim of my paper is to explore the force and limits of necessity claims in moral and political theory as a general matter.      In particular, I argue that we make use of two very different concepts of rights, one concept that serves to impose limits on institutional, welfarist considerations, and another that is far more sensitive to such considerations.  Instances of the former are core human rights protections; instances of the latter are rights over property.  We must also distinguish between two concepts of necessity, as fact and as justification.  The confusion displayed in legal and philosophical thought concerning torture in extremes is a consequence of the failure to grasp these distinctions.  When necessity is deployed as a justification, it vitiates the content of the principles it claims to override, and lends itself to the psychological and institutional abuses of which we have such stark evidence.  Understanding necessity as fact, by contrast, demands that we resist the impulse towards justifying and institutionalizing the exception, while acknowledging the theoretical limits of the justifying force of our principles.    
I also pursue in this paper the striking parallels between the Administration's claims of emergency power and exceptional justification, and the political theory of Carl Schmitt, the German constitutional thinker who developed an argument about the need for extra-constitutional executive power in times of existential crisis for the Weimar Republic.  As with Schmitt's theory, the administration's theory gains (potential) executive effectiveness at the cost of rejecting two of the deepest legacies of the Enlightenment: the inviolability of the individual and the priority of right to power.

	",122.0,"Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), represented a pivotal moment in the Supreme Court's effort to determine the scope of Congress's power ""[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.""  Together with NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1 (1937), and United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100 (1941), Filburn is widely thought to have marked a turning point in commerce clause jurisprudence.  Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court severely undermined what had been regarded as the post-New Deal consensus on the scope of Congress's commerce power.  This reconsideration of commerce clause doctrine warrants careful reexamination of Wickard v. Filburn.    
This article tells the story of Wickard v. Filburn.  After providing a brief survey of American agriculture and its regulation between the World Wars, this article describes the specific controversy over Roscoe Filburn's 1941 wheat crop.  In its own time, Wickard v. Filburn represented merely one component of the New Deal Court's commerce clause jurisprudence.  Greater turmoil over the commerce clause at the turn of the twenty-first century has breathed new life into Filburn.  This article therefore examines not only what Filburn meant at the time of its decision, but also what it represents in our time.

	",63.0,"This article explores the nature and origins of Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens' engagement with international and foreign law and norms. It first discusses Stevens' pivotal role in the revived use of such norms to aid constitutional interpretation, as well as 1990s opinions testing the extent to which constitutional protections reach beyond the water's edge and 2004 opinions on post-September 11 detention. It then turns to mid-century experiences that appear to have contributed to Stevens' willingness to consult foreign context. The article reveals that as a code breaker Stevens played a role in the downing of the Japanese general responsible for attacking Pearl Harbor, and that this sowed seeds of concern about another targeted state killing, capital punishment. Also illuminating are memoranda from Stevens' clerkship with Justice Wiley Rutledge. Parts of Stevens' drafts found their way into two Rutledge opinions whose themes remain relevant: one decried executive detention of German nationals; the other, denial of meaningful review to an Italian teenager who had pleaded guilty to murder in a hearing at which the arresting officer acted as interpreter. Fully six years before the decision in Brown v. Board of Education, clerk Stevens advised that segregation be ruled unconstitutional.

	",11.0,"The efficient market hypothesis is a special case in finance.  It explains only tiny fractions of observed phenomena.  Perhaps its major contribution is a formal definition of an ideal market world, to which policy formulations may be directed and against which they can be measured.  Indeed, it seems unlikely that the infirmities of market action ever will be so minuscule as to render the EMH more than a special case, though it may explain more in the future than it does now.  However things evolve, during the evolutionary course the shackles of the EMH should be unloosed from corporate and investing culture.    
Part I presents behavioral finance as to how prices of stocks are formed?including a theoretical framework, empirical evidence, and psychological explanations.  It integrates these materials into a model of market and investor behavior that can be used as a lens through which to analyze a wide variety of legal rules and policies bearing on market regulation and corporate governance. Part II is a series of prescriptions on the implications of this account relating to investor governance.  It starts with a proposal to promote and expand investor education concerning the cognitive biases behavioral finance exposes. It proceeds to introduce and propose reforms in three critical areas of law and policy that this model impacts: (1) the market regulatory environment in which investors participate, including suitability and churning rules and policies relating to day trading, margin trading, and circuit breakers; (2) the legal duties of boards of directors in making capital allocation decisions such as equity offerings, dividend distributions and stock acquisitions; and (3) issues in corporate and securities litigation, principally the reliance requirement in securities fraud cases and the stock market exception to the appraisal remedy in cash out mergers.      
The efficient market idea turns out to be an aspiration worth pursuing, but one never likely to be realized.  These proposals and prescriptions therefore operate both to push the reality toward the ideal and to deal with the gap that will persist.  The article has a major public policy subtext too, at stake in the discussion of how prices are formed is the overarching question of capital allocation.  Society is better off in terms of aggregate wealth when its resources are allocated to those best able to deploy them.  Investors allocating capital based on rational calculation will produce that result, while those allocating based on sentiment will not.    
A word on methodology concludes the piece concerning where the piece fits in the bourgeoning legal literature drawing on behavioral social science.   Throughout the intellectual history and genealogy of behavioral finance, legal scholars with a  social science inclination have drawn on various strands of thought pioneered in these fields, importing the work of the cognitive psychologists, principally behavioral decision theory (which they call BDT).  Concerns of the lead importers center on the usefulness of BDT to legal scholarship and policymaking generally include whether all it will do is furnish criticism of law and economics and fail to offer its own positive theories of law or normative prescriptions.  Whatever power BDT has for legal scholarship in general, this Article should leave no doubt that it furnishes a positive theory of market behavior quite different than that of efficiency (imported and promoted by some law and economics devotees) and that this theory carries with it substantial normative implications for law and legal policy in the fields of securities and corporate law.

Durapolists have long argued that, unlike perishable-goods monopolists, they face difficulties in exercising market power despite their monopolistic position. During the past thirty years, economists have extensively studied the individual arguments durapolists deploy regarding their inability to exert market power. While economists have confirmed some of these arguments, a general framework for analyzing durapolists as a distinct group of monopolists has not emerged. This Article offers such a framework. It first presents the problems of durapolists in exercising market power and explains how courts have treated these problems. It then analyzes the strategies durapolists have devised to overcome difficulties in acquiring and maintaining monopoly power and the legal implications of these strategies. This Article's major contributions are (a) expanding the conceptual scope of the durapolist problem, (b) presenting the durapolist problem as an explanation for many common business practices employed by durapolists, and (c) analyzing the legal implications of strategies employed to overcome the durapolist problem.

CSR is defined as a program of actions taken to reduce externalized costs or to avoid distributional conflicts. It is an institution that has evolved in response to market failures, a Coasian solution to some problems associated with social costs. The analysis suggests that there is a resource-allocation role for CSR programs in cases of market failure through private-social cost differentials, and also in cases where distributional disagreements are likely to be strong. In some sectors of the economy private and social costs are roughly in line and distributional debates are unusual: here corporate social responsibility has little role to play. Such sectors are outnumbered by those where CSR can play a valuable role in ensuring that the invisible hand acts, as intended, to produce the social good.

	",174.0,"On February 20, 2006, Michael Morales was hours away from execution in California when two anesthesiologists declined to participate in his lethal injection procedure, thereby halting all state executions. The events brought to the surface the long-running schism between law and medicine, raising the question of whether any beneficial connection between the professions ever existed in the execution context. History shows it seldom did. Decades of botched executions prove it.    
This Article examines how states ended up with such constitutionally vulnerable lethal injection procedures, suggesting that physician participation in executions, though looked upon with disdain, is more prevalent - and perhaps more necessary - than many would like to believe. The Article also reports the results of this author's unique nationwide study of lethal injection protocols and medical participation. The study demonstrates that states have continued to produce grossly inadequate protocols that severely restrict sufficient understanding of how executions are performed and heighten the likelihood of unconstitutionality. The analysis emphasizes in particular the utter lack of medical or scientific testing of lethal injection despite the early and continuous involvement of doctors but ongoing detachment of medical societies. Lastly, the Article discusses the legal developments that led up to the current rush of lethal injection lawsuits as well as the strong and rapid reverberations that followed, particularly with respect to medical involvement.    
This Article concludes with two recommendations. First, much like what occurred in this country when the first state switched to electrocution, there should be a nationwide study of proper lethal injection protocols. An independent commission consisting of a diverse group of qualified individuals, including medical personnel, should conduct a thorough assessment of lethal injection, especially the extent of physician participation. Second, this Article recommends that states take their execution procedures out of hiding. Such visibility would increase public scrutiny, thereby enhancing the likelihood of constitutional executions.    
By clarifying the standards used for determining what is constitutional in Baze v. Rees, the U.S. Supreme Court can then provide the kind of Eighth Amendment guidance states need to conduct humane lethal injections.

	",73.0,"A popular myth in American constitutional law is that the strict scrutiny standard of review applied to enforce rights such as free speech and equal protection is, in the famous words of Gerald Gunther, 'strict' in theory and fatal in fact. In recent years, however, this traditional understanding of strict scrutiny's inevitable deadliness has been challenged in high-profile cases such as Adarand Constructors v. Pena, where the Supreme Court expressed the wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is 'strict' in theory, but fatal in fact, and Grutter v. Bollinger, where the Court turned wish into action and upheld an affirmative action policy under strict scrutiny. According to the Court in Grutter, when applying strict scrutiny, [c]ontext matters.    
This Article offers a systematic empirical study of strict scrutiny in the federal courts. Reporting the results of a census of every strict scrutiny decision published by the district, circuit, and Supreme courts between 1990 and 2003, this study shows that strict scrutiny is far from the inevitably deadly test imagined by the Gunther myth and more closely resembles the context-sensitive tool described by O'Connor. Overall, 30% of all applications of strict scrutiny - nearly one in three - result in the challenged law being upheld. Rather than fatal in fact, strict scrutiny is survivable in fact, and is so across constitutional doctrine: 27% of suspect classifications, 22% of free speech restrictions, 24% of fundamental rights infringements, 33% of freedom of association burdens, and 59% of religious liberty burdens adjudicated under strict scrutiny survive.    
Employing logistic regression, this Article shows that this high survival rate for a supposedly fatal standard of review is context-sensitive. Although political ideology and regional variation are found to have no significant impact on voting in strict scrutiny cases, courts are strongly influenced by the identity of the governmental actor. Most prominently, laws adopted by the federal government are far more likely to survive (50%) than those adopted by state (29%) or local (17%) governments. Surprisingly, however, strict scrutiny has become more fatal in the years since Adarand declared the standard to be survivable (from 40% in the early 1990s to 20% in the early 2000s).    
I also offer an in-depth look at strict scrutiny cases within each area of law where that standard is found, showing which types of laws are more likely to be upheld than others even within discrete doctrines.

	",,"Federal statutes do not come with instructions, but maybe they should. For as long as there have been statutes, lawyers and laymen have puzzled over their inevitable ambiguities.  Gradually, case by case, courts have developed assorted tools of interpretation.  Scholars, meanwhile, have conceived esoteric theories of how best to resolve statutory ambiguity.  And the doctrine and the scholarship have become elaborate and sophisticated. But the very richness of this intellectual landscape has resulted in unpredictability and confusion. As theories and judges have multiplied, it has become ever more difficult to predict which judge will apply which theory to which case. And after centuries of judicial and scholarly effort, there is still no generally accepted theory of statutory interpretation.    
The central, unquestioned premise in this field is that the judiciary is the proper branch to design and implement tools of statutory interpretation. Scholars have unreflectively assumed as much, which is why, almost uniformly, they have implicitly aimed their work at the courts. This Article challenges that assumption. It asks whether Congress can and should help select the tools for interpreting federal statutes. The constitutional question turns out to be as important as the answer, because it adds a vital and neglected dimension to the debate about statutory interpretation. To ask whether Congress may codify a particular interpretive method is precisely to ask whether the Constitution requires the method that is to be displaced. This inquiry proves essential in locating statutory interpretation under the constitutional firmament. This Article concludes that Congress has constitutional power to codify some tools of statutory interpretation. Congress has used this power in the past, but only sporadically and unselfconsciously, at the periphery of the United States Code. The power itself is vast, however, and could transform the landscape of statutory interpretation. Because this power has received minimal systematic analysis, there is extraordinary potential for imprudent or unconstitutional overreaching. But used wisely, congressional power to legislate interpretive strategies may improve legislative-judicial communication and thus bring our legal system closer to its democratic ideal.    
This article therefore advocates codifying certain interpretive tools and techniques. And it suggests that the best form of codification would be as a set of federal rules: the Federal Rules of Statutory Interpretation.

	",15.0,"Three years ago, as America was preparing to go to war in Iraq, there were few discussions of the likely costs. When Larry Lindsey, President Bush's economic adviser, suggested that they might reach $200 billion, there was a quick response from the White House: that number was a gross overestimation. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz claimed that Iraq could ""really finance its own reconstruction,"" apparently both underestimating what was required and the debt burden facing the country. Lindsey went on to say that ""The successful prosecution of the war would be good for the economy."" Many aspects of the Iraq venture have turned out differently from what was purported before the war: there were no weapons of mass destruction, no clear link between Al Qaeda and Iraq, no imminent danger that would warrant a pre-emptive war. Whether Americans were greeted as liberators or not, there is evidence that that they are now viewed as occupiers. Stability has not been established. Clearly, the benefits of the War have been markedly different from those claimed. So too for the costs. It now appears that Lindsey was indeed wrong - by grossly underestimating the costs.... The Congressional Budget Office has now estimated that in their central, mid-range scenario, the Iraq war will cost over $266 billion more in the next decade, putting the direct costs of the war in the range of $500 billion. These estimates, however, underestimate the War's true costs to America by a wide margin. In this paper, we attempt to provide a range of estimates for what those costs have been, and are likely to be. Even taking a conservative approach, we have been surprised at how large they are. We can state, with some degree of confidence, that they exceed a trillion dollars.

	",127.0,"Paul Ricoeur famously dubbed that great triumvirate of late nineteenth - and early twentieth-century thought - Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud - ""the school of suspicion,"" by which he meant those thinkers who taught us to regard with suspicion our conscious understandings and experience, whether the deliverances of ordinary psychological introspection about one's desires (""I really want to be rich!""), or the moral categories political leaders and ordinary citizens apply to themselves and the social world they inhabit (""an inheritance tax is an immoral death tax!"").  ""Beneath"" or ""behind"" the surface lay causal forces that explained the conscious phenomena precisely because they laid bare the true meaning of those phenomena: I don't really want lots of money, I want the love I never got as a child; survivors have no moral claim on an inheritance, but it is in the interests of the ruling classes that we believe they do; and so on.    
Recent years have been, in now familiar ways, unkind to Marx and Freud.  Yet instead of a frontal assault on the critiques of the explanatory programs of Marx and Freud, the defense of their legacy in the English-speaking world has gradually fallen to those I will call moralizing interpreters of their thought.  The moralizing readers de-emphasize (or simply reject) the explanatory and causal claims in the work of Marx and Freud, and try to marry more-or-less Marxian and Freudian ideas to various themes in normative ethics and political philosophy.  Explanation of phenomena is abandoned in favor of the more traditional philosophical enterprise of justification, whether of the just distribution of resources or the possibility of morality's authority.  So, for example, G.A. Cohen, the most influential of English-language Marx interpreters in recent decades, has declared that ""Marxism has lost much or most of its [empirical] carapace, its hard shell of supposed fact"" and that, as a result, ""Marxists . . . are increasingly impelled into normative political philosophy.""  (Under the influence of Habermas, the Marxist tradition has taken a similar turn on the Continent.)  Similarly, a leading moral philosopher notes that, ""Just when philosophers of science thought they had buried Freud for the last time, he has quietly reappeared in the writings of moral philosophers"" and goes on to claim that ""Freud's theory of the superego provides a valuable psychological model for various aspects of (Kant's) Categorical Imperative.""  On these new renderings, Marx and Freud command our attention because they are really just complements (or correctives) to Rawls or Korsgaard, really just normative theorists who can be made to join in a contemporary dialogue about equality and the authority of morality.    
Nietzsche, too, has been transformed by moralizing interpreters, though in a somewhat different way.  The crucial development here has been the retreat from the natural reading of Nietzsche as a philosopher engaged in an attack on morality - a reading first articulated by the Danish scholar Georg Brandes more than a century ago - in favor of a reading which presents Nietzsche as fundamentally concerned with questions of truth and knowledge: the moralistic scruples of interpreters are satisfied by treating Nietzsche as concerned with something else, something less morally alarming than a ""revaluation of values.""    
I shall argue that, in fact, all three of the great practitioners of the hermeneutics of suspicion have suffered at the hands of moralizing interpreters who have resisted the essentially naturalistic thrust of their conception of philosophical practice.  As a matter of both textual exegesis and intellectual importance, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are best read as primarily naturalistic thinkers, that is thinkers who view philosophical inquiry as continuous with a sound empirical understanding of the natural world and the causal forces operative in it.  When one understands conscious life naturalistically, in terms of its real causes, one contributes at the same time to a critique of the contents of consciousness: that, in short, is the essence of a hermeneutics of suspicion.

	",59.0,"A wardriver gets in her car and drives around a given area. Using her laptop, freely available software, a standard Wi-Fi card, and a GPS device, she logs the status and location of wireless networks. The computer generates a file and records networks that are open and networks that are closed. Once the data is collected, the wardriver may denote an open network by using chalk to mark a sign on a building, called ""warchalking,"" or she may record the location on a digital map and publish it on the Internet. This article will explain the roots of the term ""wardriving,"" and the cultural phenomenon of the 1983 Hollywood movie WarGames that gave birth to the concept more than 20 years ago. Moreover, this article will show that the press has often confused wardriving with computer crimes involving trespass and illegal access. There are inconspicuous ethical shades to wardriving that are poorly understood, and to date, no academic literature has analyzed the legality of the activity. This article will argue that the act of wardriving itself is quite innocuous, legal, and can even be quite beneficial to society. It will also highlight the need for wardrivers - and for anyone accessing open networks - to help establish and adhere to strict ethical guidelines. Such guidelines are available in various proposal-stage forms, and this article will review these ethics within the context of a larger movement among hackers to develop a coherent ethical code.

We argue that STTs are best thought of as taxes on different resources used in transactions: domestic brokerage services in the case of Sweden, and registration services in the British case. STTs give investors incentives to economize on the taxed resources by shifting trading to foreign markets or untaxed assets, or by reducing the volume of trade.  We show that these effects can be important. Estimated revenues from an STT will be correspondingly overstated if they ignore such behavioral effects.

This Article considers these materials and sheds new light on two questions.  Does Congress's power to declare war encompass the authority to decide whether the nation will wage war?  Relatedly, does Congress's power to decide whether the country will wage war extend to those situations where another nation already has declared war on the United States?  This Article answers both questions in the affirmative.  In the eighteenth century the power to declare war was a power to decide whether a nation would wage war.  Materials from that era reveal that any decision to wage war, however expressed, was a declaration of war.  The commencement of warfare was regarded as the surest declaration of war.  Because the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, only Congress can determine whether the nation will start a war or enter a war against a nation that already has declared war against the United States.  Necessarily, the President cannot unilaterally choose to wage war against another nation, even when that nation has already declared war.

	",128.0,"Currently, we are in the midst of a reexamination of chief executive officer (CEO) remuneration that has more than the usual amount of energy and substance. While much of the fury over CEO pay has been aimed at executives associated with accounting scandals and collapses in the prices of their company's shares, the controversies over GE CEO Jack Welch and NYSE CEO Richard Grasso signal a watershed. In their cases the competence and performance of both men were unquestioned: the issue seems to be the perception that they received ""too much"" and that there was inadequate disclosure.     
We provide, history, analysis and over three dozen recommendations for reforming the system surrounding executive compensation.    
Section I introduces a conceptual framework for analyzing remuneration and incentives in organizations. We then analyze the agency problems between managers and shareholders and between board members and shareholders, and discuss how well designed pay packages can mitigate the former while well designed corporate governance policies and processes can mitigate the latter. We say ""mitigate"" because no solutions will eliminate these agency problems completely. Since bad governance can easily lead to value destroying pay practices our discussion includes analyses of corporate governance as well as pay design. Because optimal remuneration policies cannot be designed and managed without consideration of the powerful relations and interactions between the financial markets and the firm, its top-level executives and the board, we devote significant space to these factors.    
Section II offers a brief history of executive remuneration from 1970 to the present. Section III examines and explains the forces behind the US-led escalation in share options. We argue that boards and managers falsely perceive stock options to be inexpensive because of accounting and cash-flow considerations and, as a result, too many options have been awarded to too many people.    
Section IV defines and discusses the agency costs of overvalued equity as the source of recent corporate scandals. Agency problems associated with overvalued equity are aggravated when managers have large holdings of stock or options. Because neither the market for corporate control or the usual incentive compensation systems can solve the agency problems of overvalued equity, they must be resolved by corporate governance systems. And few governance systems were strong enough to solve the problems. As the overvalued equity problem illustrates, while remuneration can be a solution to agency problems, it can also be a source of agency problems.     
Section V discusses several widespread problems with pay processes and practices, and suggests changes in both corporate governance and pay design to mitigate such problems: including problems with the appointment and pay-setting process, problems with equity-based pay plans, and problems with the design of traditional bonus plans. We show how traditional plans encourage managers to ignore the cost of capital, manage earnings in ways that destroy value, and take actions to deceive investors and capital markets.    
Section VI defines and analyzes a new concept: what we call the Strategic Value Accountability issue. This is the accountability for making the link between strategy formulation and choice and the value consequences of those choices - basically the link between internal managers and external capital markets. The critical importance of this accountability, its assignment, and its implications for performance measurement and remuneration have long been unrecognized and therefore ignored in most organizations.    
Section VII analyzes the complex relationships between managers, analysts, and the capital market, the incentives firms have to manage earnings to meet or beat analyst forecasts, and shows how managers playing the earnings-management game systematically erode the integrity of their organization and destroy organizational value. We highlight the puzzling equilibrium in this market that seems to suggest collusion between analysts and managers at the expense of investors - an area that is ripe for further research.

In an article published last year, The Case for Increasing Shareholder Power, I advocated providing shareholders with power to make rules-of-the-game decisions. A forthcoming exchange in the Harvard law Review will feature responses by Professor Stephen Bainbridge and Vice-Chancellor Leo Strine taking issue with my proposal. This paper, which was written for this exchange, responds to Bainbridge and Strine as well as further develops my arguments for increasing shareholder power. I discuss the significant costs arising from boards control over rules-of-the-game decisions during the often long life of public companies. Discussing the objections raised by critics, I show that giving shareholders power to make rules-of-the-game decisions would be consistent with centralized management in public companies; would not be made unnecessary by reforms in corporate elections; and should not dismissed on the grounds that it would already be offered by corporate charters or state law rules if it were beneficial. I also address concerns arising from the shortcomings of institutional investors. I conclude that there is a strong case for a serious reexamination of boards' control over the rules of the game.

	",,"In this book, the first to offer a comprehensive examination of the emerging study of law as literature, Guyora Binder and Robert Weisberg show that law is not only a scheme of social order, but also a process of creating meaning, and a crucial dimension of modern culture. They present lawyers as literary innovators, who creatively interpret legal authority, narrate disputed facts and hypothetical fictions, represent persons before the law, move audiences with artful rhetoric, and invent new legal forms and    concepts. Binder and Weisberg explain the literary theories and methods increasingly applied to law, and they introduce and synthesize the work of over a hundred authors in the fields of law, literature, philosophy, and cultural studies.    
Drawing on these disparate bodies of scholarship, Binder and Weisberg analyze law as interpretation, narration, rhetoric, language, and culture, placing each of these approaches within the history of literary and legal thought. They sort the styles of analysis most likely to sharpen critical understanding from those that risk self-indulgent sentimentalism or sterile skepticism, and they endorse a broadly synthetic cultural criticism that views law as an arena for composing and contesting identity, status, and character. Such a cultural criticism would evaluate law not simply as a device for realizing rights and interests but also as the framework for a vibrant cultural life.

	",42.0,"The power of shareholders to replace the board is a central element in the accepted theory of the modern public corporation with dispersed ownership. This power, however, is largely a myth. I document in this paper that the incidence of electoral challenges during the 1996-2005 decade was very low. After presenting this evidence, the paper analyzes why electoral challenges to directors are so rare, and then makes the case for arrangements that would provide shareholders with a viable power to remove directors. Under the proposed default arrangements, companies will have, at least every two years, elections with shareholder access to the corporate ballot, reimbursement of campaign expenses for candidates who receive a sufficiently significant number of votes (for example, one-third of the votes cast), and the opportunity to replace all the directors; companies will also have secret ballot and majority voting in all directors elections. Furthermore, opting out of default election arrangements through shareholder-approved bylaws should be facilitated, but boards should be constrained from adopting without shareholder approval bylaws that make director removal more difficult. Finally, I examine a wide range of possible objections to the proposed reform of corporate elections, and I conclude that they do not undermine the case for such a reform.

	",13.0,"This report describes the use of Bayesian networks (BNs) to model statistical loss distributions in financial operational risk scenarios. Its focus is on modeling ""long tail"", or unexpected, loss events using mixtures of appropriate loss frequency and severity distributions where these mixtures are conditioned on causal variables that model the capability or effectiveness of the underlying controls process. The use of causal modeling is discussed from the perspective of exploiting local expertise about process reliability and formally connecting this knowledge to actual or hypothetical statistical phenomena resulting from the process. This brings the benefit of supplementing sparse data with expert judgment and transforming qualitative knowledge about the process into quantitative predictions. We conclude that BNs can help combine qualitative data from experts and quantitative data from historical loss databases in a principled way and as such they go some way in meeting the requirements of the draft Basel II Accord (Basel, 2004) for an advanced measurement approach (AMA).

This issue is considered within the broader political and social context of the nation's 'war on drugs' and wide-ranging trends in American immigration policy. We argue that state drug offenses should be analogous to the traditional federal characterizations of a felony (i.e. yielding more than a year of imprisonment) in order to be appropriately considered aggravated felonies. We conclude that interpretations of the aggravated felony provisions that allow offenses falling below this threshold to be considered aggravated felonies are misguided, lead to unwarranted collateral immigration consequences for non-citizens, and fit within a broader pattern of inordinate burden sharing in the war on drugs by historically disempowered groups.

	",58.0,"Open innovation is a powerful framework encompassing the generation, capture, and employment of intellectual property at the firm level. We identify three fundamental challenges for firms in applying the concept of open innovation: finding creative ways to exploit internal innovation, incorporating external innovation into internal development, and motivating outsiders to supply an ongoing stream of external innovations. This latter challenge involves a paradox, why would firms spend money on R&D efforts if the results of these efforts are available to rival firms? To explore these challenges, we examine the activity of firms in open-source software to support their innovation strategies. Firms involved in open-source software often make investments that will be shared with real and potential rivals. We identify four strategies firms employ - pooled R&D/product development, spinouts, selling complements and attracting donated complements - and discuss how they address the three key challenges of open innovation. We conclude with suggestions for how similar strategies may apply in other industries and offer some possible avenues for future research on open innovation.

	",26.0,"This essay critiques Professor Orin Kerr's provocative article, The Fourth Amendment and New Technologies: Constitutional Myths and the Case for Caution, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 801 (2004). Increasingly, Fourth Amendment protection is receding from a litany of law enforcement activities, and it is being replaced by federal statutes. Kerr notes these developments and argues that courts should place a thumb on the scale in favor of judicial caution when technology is in flux, and should consider allowing legislatures to provide the primary rules governing law enforcement investigations involving new technologies. Kerr's key contentions are that (1) legislatures create rules that are more comprehensive, balanced, clear, and flexible; (2) legislatures are better able to keep up with technological change; and (3) legislatures are more adept at understanding complex new technologies.    
I take issue with each of these arguments. Regarding Kerr's first contention, I argue that Congress has created an uneven fabric of protections that is riddled with holes and weak safeguards. Kerr's second contention - that legislatures are better able to update rules quickly as technology shifts - is belied by the historical record, which suggests Congress is actually far worse than the courts in reacting to new technologies. As for Kerr's third contention, shifting to a statutory regime will not eliminate Kerr's concern with judges misunderstanding technology. In fact, many judicial misunderstandings stem from courts trying to fit new technologies into an old statutory regime that is built around old technologies.    
Therefore, while Kerr is right that our attention must focus more on the statutes, he is wrong in urging for a deferential judicial approach to the Fourth Amendment.

	",7.0,"This study ranks twenty-five world equity markets from the North American, European, Middle-eastern and Asia-Pacific regions on the twin objectives of market efficiency and integrity. Though rhetoric from the chosen markets suggest that these are equally important goals we find evidence that their importance varies significantly across markets. The key findings of the study are that the Deustche Boerse and the New York Stock Exchange stand out among their international peers as markets of high efficiency and integrity. Notwithstanding the performance of these markets, European markets hold eight of the top ten places while the top three Asia-Pacific markets are New Zealand, Tokyo and Hong Kong exchanges ranked 11th, 12th and 14th respectively. While the Deutsche Boerse - floor trading in Frankfurt, holds the mantel as the market with the highest integrity, its ranking on efficiency is much lower at 14th. This is symptomatic of a more pervasive result, namely, that efficient markets are not necessarily markets with higher integrity and vice versa.  Euronext Paris which is ranked 2nd on efficiency is only ranked 19th on integrity is evidence of the latter. Given the disparity between the two goals, scope appears to exist for international alliances among securities markets with the objective of enhancing one or the other goal.

No sooner was the paradigm firmly established with the 1968 Donovan Report and 1970 foundation of the Industrial Relations Research Unit at Warwick University (among other markers), than it faced new challenges and, arguably breakdown. These challenges came, first, from 1970s New Left Marxism, riding on a tide of industrial and student unrest, and then from 1980s Thatcherism and the destruction of workplace industrial relations. The article concludes by outlining six main strengths of the British IR paradigm and looking forward to how IR can regain its relevance in the very different world of work that lies ahead.

	",4.0,"In 1994, when most of the world's trading nations agreed to create the WTO, they also agreed to begin to liberalize trade in services. What no one fully realized at the time (and not all realize now) is that those decisions placed the WTO in the midst of internet regulation. Much internet content can be reached from anywhere, making nearly everyone on the internet a potential importer or exporter of services (and sometimes goods). Hence, almost by accident, the WTO has put itself in an oversight position for most of the national laws and practices that regulate the internet.    
Over the last five years, national governments have begun to impose more controls over the internet - in particular, filters that keep certain forms of applications or content out. The inevitable effect is to create barriers to trade in services. Countries have filtered or blocked internet imports without seeming to think twice about the consistency of such actions under WTO law. More such practices will fall under WTO scrutiny in the years ahead. For the most part, WTO oversight will be invisible. Yet in other areas the influence of the WTO will no doubt help shape the future of international internet transactions - and the internet itself.    
In its introduction to problems of trade in internet-based services, this paper focuses on two cases: one a country and one a product. The national study is of China, among the world's more comprehensive internet regulators. China makes for an interesting case because as a condition to accession to the WTO, it agreed to what has been called ""radical"" reform of its service practices. Yet at the same time China is among the world's more active filterers of internet services. As we shall see, these two positions are in tension, and while WTO law leaves much room for exceptions, some of China's restrictions may not be easily justifiable under the GATS.    
The second study is of the company Skype, a provider of voice over Internet services. Skype offers free voice telephone services to anyone with an internet connection. As a consequences, incumbent telephony carriers, often state-owned, have a strong competitive interest in preventing Skype from reaching their customers. The instances of Skype blocking in several countries raise interesting trade in services issues.    
This paper is meant for two audiences. For those within the world of trade law it clarifies how internet services have leapt beyond what was contemplated in GATS or subsequent telecommunications agreements. The universalization of a network that is a platform for any type of service requires new thinking about how barriers may come about, and how sectoral commitments are interpreted. For those within the world of telecommunications or internet law, this paper introduces the relevance of WTO law to national regulation of internet services. One of the most interesting consequences may be a tempering of what we might call the ""Yahoo! Presumption""; that is, the presumption that the burden lies with internet companies to adapt to national legal systems. While still generally true, the tendency in WTO jurisprudence is to put the burden on national governments to justify internet blocking.

	",75.0,"Based on data from 2091 call centre representatives working in 85 call centres in the UK, central assumptions of affective events theory (AET) are tested. AET predicts that specific features of work (e.g. autonomy) have an impact on the arousal of emotions and moods at work that, in turn, co-determine job satisfaction of employees. AET further proposes that job satisfaction is an evaluative judgement that mainly explains cognitive-based behaviour, whereas emotions and moods better predict affective-based behaviour. The results support these assumptions. A clear separation of key constructs (job satisfaction, positive and negative emotions) was possible. Moreover, correlations between several work features (e.g. supervisory support) and job satisfaction were, in part, mediated by work emotions, even when controlling for gender, age, call centre type (in-house versus outsourced centres) and call centre size. Predictions regarding consequences of satisfaction and affect were partly corroborated as continuance commitment was more strongly related to job satisfaction than to positive emotions. In addition, affective commitment and health complaints were related to both emotions and job satisfaction to the same extent. Thus, AET is a fruitful framework for explaining why and how specific management strategies used for designing work features influence important organizational attitudes and well-being of employees.

	",5.0,"Since the public corporation first evolved as a business form, there has been a lively debate over whether its proper purpose always is to maximize shareholder wealth, or whether directors sometimes can consider the interests of creditors, employees, and other corporate stakeholders.  This article reviews why two of the arguments traditionally used to justify strict shareholder primacy - that shareholders own the corporation, and that shareholders are the sole residual claimants of corporations - are bad arguments, in the sense that they are demonstrably incorrect from both an economic and a legal perspective.    
The article then explores a third and better argument for shareholder primacy: that requiring corporate directors to serve only shareholders is the best way to keep directors from imposing excessive agency costs on firms.  This agency cost argument recognizes that in an ideal world, directors would take account of the interests of both shareholders and other stakeholders.  Indeed, allowing this can provide ex ante benefits to shareholders by encouraging nonshareholder groups to make firm-specific commitments to corporate team production.  Nevertheless (the argument goes), a rule of strict shareholder primacy remains preferable, because it permits corporations to monitor and reward director performance according to a single easily-observed metric: stock price.    
While plausible in theory, the agency cost argument for strict shareholder primacy suffers from a serious weakness.  In practice, the business world displays a strong revealed preference for corporate governance rules that grant directors discretion to serve stakeholder groups, even at shareholders' ex post expense.  What's more, this pattern is observed when firms are first incorporated and brought public, a time when corporate promoters have every incentive to cater to shareholder interests.  Such observations suggest that business participants believe the ex ante benefits of allowing directors to consider stakeholder interests outweigh the ex post harms in terms of greater agency costs.  They also raise serious questions about the empirical strength of the agency cost argument for ex post shareholder primacy.

	",17.0,"Social security is concerned on easing the impact of contingencies that lead to capacity loss for generating income. There are, however, conceptual differences between genders with respect to social security contributions and benefits. This text is concerned with equality and specificity in the treatment given to the different genders. Equality and specificity between sexes can be attributed to, basically, two different reasons: Biological and socio-cultural factors. Biological differences lead to issues around reproductive functions (birth and nursing). Socio-cultural differences lead to constructs defined in the specific society (cultural and religious values, family ties and hierarchy, labor market sexual bias, patterns of schooling, etc.). They show up in the labor market, in family structure and in levels of schooling. This text places social security in a historical perspective of the in[equality] between genders at a international as well as a national level. International unified concerns with equality and specificity between genders in the realm of social security are relatively recent. Only in 1919 the ILO - International Labour Organization formulated its first convention dealing with issues related to maternity protection. ILO conventions dealing with women protection with respect to social security benefits as well as the main issues defended by women organizations in world conferences sponsored by United Nations are presented and analyzed in this paper. For the Brazilian context, it is presented a list of the main differences between men and women with respect to social security benefits. Brazilian social security benefits are characterized by a major male profile. That is seen as a consequence of their predominance in the formal labor market in terms of quantity and of quality of position and relative earnings. Consequently, women benefit values are lower than men's. This situation is not due to social security rules and regulations unfairness of treatment but only reflects the actual situation in the labor market. In order to best understand the Brazilian situation and to place in the international context, legislation in 60 countries are compared. The comparison includes information disaggregated by gender on: minimum age for retirement, eligibility conditions for survivor's pension, maternity benefits and family responsibilities.

	",27.0,"In addition to attractive returns, many hedge funds claim to provide significant diversification for traditional portfolios.  This paper empirically examines the return and diversification benefits of hedge fund investing using the CSFB/Tremont hedge fund indices from 1994-2000.  We, like many others, find that simple regressions of monthly hedge fund excess returns on monthly S&P 500 excess returns seem to support the claims.  The regressions show only modest market exposure and positive added value.  However, this type of analysis can produce misleading results.  Many hedge funds hold, to various degrees and combinations, illiquid exchange-traded securities or difficult-to-price over-the-counter securities.  For the purposes of monthly reporting, hedge funds often price these securities using either last available traded prices or estimates of current market prices.  These practices can lead to reported monthly hedge fund returns that are not perfectly synchronous with monthly S&P 500 returns due to the presence of either stale or ""managed"" prices.  Non-synchronous return data can lead to understated estimates of actual market exposure.  We employ standard techniques that account for this problem and find that hedge funds in the aggregate contain significantly more market exposure than simple estimates indicate.  Furthermore, after accounting for this increased market exposure, we find that taken as a whole the broad universe of hedge funds does not add value over this period.  With the stock market still near all-time high valuations, investors who view their hedge funds as protection from a market correction should consider this a potentially serious issue.

	",22.0,"In the period between 1300 and 1800 as many as one million people were executed in Europe for the crime of witchcraft. Although a variety of theories about the witch-hunts have been put forward over time, little has been said about the possibility that the witch-hunts were motivated by a desire for vengeance in a time of misfortune. This paper connects the witch-hunts in Europe with deteriorating weather and slow economic growth during this period.  The most intense period of witch-hunting coincided with a period of below-average worldwide temperatures known as the little ice age.  I find that there is a statistically significant relationship between climate and number of trials: in times of worse climate there were more trials. This finding is robust to different measures of climate. In addition, I find that in periods of slower economic growth there were more witchcraft trials, even controlling for weather patterns. I argue that the two results together suggest that vengeance may have played an important role in witchcraft persecutions.

	",54.0,"Although James Madison has been invoked by justices and judicial scholars for over one hundred years, Madison's principle of religious liberty has never been fully grasped or adopted by the Supreme Court. Judges and scholars have failed to understand Madison's radical but simple teaching that religion is not part of the social compact and, therefore, that the state may not take religion within its cognizance. This is most unfortunate because Madison offers a doctrine capable of unifying the Constitution's two religion clauses into one straightforward rule. His principle addresses the legitimate criticisms of conservative and liberal advocates who have argued, respectively, that the Supreme Court has been unnecessarily hostile toward and favorable toward religion. Madison thus speaks to the contemporary disillusionment with the Court's religion jurisprudence. A proper interpretation of his thought offers a timely and timeless understanding of the principle of religious freedom.

	",110.0,"In this paper, we review the recent literature on conflict and appropriation. Allowing for the possibility of conflict, which amounts to recognizing the possibility that property rights are not perfectly and costlessly enforced, represents a significant departure from the traditional paradigm of economics.  The research we emphasize, however, takes an economic perspective.  Specifically, it applies conventional optimization techniques and game-theoretic tools to study the allocation of resources among competing activities - productive and otherwise appropriative, such as grabbing the product and wealth of others as well as defending one's own product and wealth. In contrast to other economic activities in which inputs are combined cooperatively through production functions, the inputs to appropriation are combined adversarially through technologies of conflict.    
A central objective of this research is to identify the effects of conflict on economic outcomes: the determinants of the distribution of output (or power) and how an individual party's share can be inversely related to its marginal productivity; when settlement in the shadow of conflict and when open conflict can be expected to occur, with longer time horizons capable of inducing conflict instead of settlement; how conflict and appropriation can reduce the appeal of trade; the determinants of alliance formation and the importance of intra-alliance commitments; how dynamic incentives for capital accumulation and innovation are distorted in the presence of conflict; and the role of governance in conflict management.

It's not surprising that people have different beliefs about the deterrent effect of the death penalty, the impact of handgun ownership on crime, the significance of global warming, the public health consequences of promiscuous sex, etc. The mystery concerns the origins of such disagreement. Were either the indeterminacy of scientific evidence or the uneven dissemination of convincing data responsible, we would expect divergent beliefs on such issues to be distributed almost randomly across the population, and beliefs about seemingly unrelated questions (whether, say, the death penalty deters and whether global warming is a serious threat) to be relatively independent of one another. But this is not the case: factual disagreement is highly polarized across distinct social groups - ethnic, religious, racial, regional, and ideological. Moreover, factual beliefs highly correlate across discrete and disparate issues. What explains these patterns? The answer, we will argue, is the phenomenon of cultural cognition. We discuss original empirical evidence showing that individuals form factual beliefs that reflect and reinforce competing cultural orientations - hierarchic and egalitarian, individualistic and communitarian. We also identify the social and psychological mechanisms through which these orientations shape factual beliefs. And we discuss the implications of this phenomenon for enlightened democratic decision-making.

The rational choice methodological approach allow to construct groups of electors with different perceptions about the space in which the political race takes place, fact that induces them different electoral behaviour.

We also work out the asymptotic distribution of the statistic and its properties.

Whereas the pair-wise Sharpe ratio test show that the performance of all the 18 iShares are indistinguishable, our test results reject the equality of the Sharpe ratios in each year as well as in the entire sample; implying that the 18 iShares perform differently in each year as well as in the entire sample, with some outperforming others in the market.

	",32.0,"The comparatively poor performance of traditional asset classes in recent years has driven the search for greater returns via alternative asset classes. The desire to reap higher risk adjusted returns from diversification into assets which offer low and even negative correlation with equities and bonds is extremely desirable. There has been a huge growth in the traditional alternative investments such as real estate, commodity futures, private equity and hedge fund investments.     
Additionally, a number of funds specialising in art have recently emerged. These also appear to offer a highly beneficial diversification strategy with extremely low correlation with traditional asset classes. It is important for investors to understand the risk and return characteristics of this new alternative asset class.     
In this paper we take a closer look at art as an alternative asset, and look specifically at how this new alternative asset is expected to perform, also during bear markets, when the benefits of diversification are most needed. We look at the risk and return characteristics of art using art market indices, and the prospects for portfolio diversification in the art market using a variety of data across art market sectors, including the Old Master, European Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary art markets. Due to the low correlation of art with other asset classes, we find opportunities for portfolio diversification across art markets and across asset classes. The results hold, even allowing for the high transaction costs, which are encountered when trading art, when spread over a longer time horizon.

	",52.0,This article argues that African-American quarterbacks have faced consistent discrimination in the National Football League since Marlin Briscoe broke through the color barrier at the position in 1968.  The author identifies the issue of intelligence as central to the discrimination practiced against African-American NFL quarterbacks and identifies two central arguments traditionally used to prove the insufficiency of black intelligence to play the position - the Wonderlic argumentation and the Option argumentation.  The author identifies several problems with these arguments.  The author concludes by drawing a correlation between the argument used against African-Americans playing quarterback in the NFL and similar discrimination against African-Americans in broader society. ," quarterback, discrimination, African-American, black, National Football League, NFL, Wonderlic, intelligence",https://ssrn.com/abstract=835204http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.835204 ,Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID835204_code539447.pdf?abstractid=835204&mirid=1,Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID835204_code539447.pdf?abstractid=835204&mirid=1&type=2,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=835204,"Labor: Demographics & Economics of the Family eJournal,Race & Social Inequity eJournal,Political Behavior: Race, Ethnicity & Identity Politics eJournal","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=1480984,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=3635066,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=999052"," J71, L83, Z00",9,17,2,18,4

	",32.0,"Our society has long esteemed the sanctity of conscience, and our legal system has reflected that esteem, effectively shielding the individual from state encroachment, especially in matters of religion.  A rapidly expanding range of disputes, however, is not readily settled under the individual-versus-state paradigm; rather, the new battle lines are forming between consumer and provider, with both driven to live out the dictates of conscience in the marketplace.  The legal community has been slow to adjust to this trend, presuming reflexively that resolutions are best reached by harnessing state power to defend some conception of individual conscience, as exemplified by pharmacists' well-publicized entry onto the center stage of our nation's ongoing culture war drama.  One side invokes conscience to justify legislation that would empower pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions on moral grounds without the possibility of negative consequences; the other side invokes conscience on behalf of the consumer to justify legislation that would require all pharmacies to fill all valid prescriptions.  Congress and the dozens of state legislatures to take up the issue have embraced the winner-take-all terms in which the combatants have framed the contest.  This article asks us to step back from these two-dimensional terms of engagement and to contextualize the public relevance of conscience by outlining the contours of a marketplace where moral claims can operate and compete without invoking the trump of state power.  Instead of making all pharmacies morally fungible via state edict, the market allows individual consciences to thrive through overlapping webs of morality-driven associations and allegiances, even while diametrically opposed consciences similarly thrive.  The zero-sum contest over the reins of state power is replaced by a reinvigorated civil society, allowing the commercial sphere to reflect our moral pluralism.

Although the rationality of these forecasts has often been rejected, earlier studies rely on the assumption that positive and negative forecast errors of identical magnitude are equally important to forecasters. Allowing for homogenous asymmetric loss, our evidence still strongly rejects forecast rationality. However, if we allow for variation in asymmetric loss functions across forecasters, we not only find significant differences in preferences, but we can also often no longer reject forecast rationality.

	",26.0,"The Supreme Court's 2005 decision in Gonzales v. Raich severely undermined hopes that the Court might enforce meaningful constitutional limits on congressional power. In the aftermath of Raich, some observers hoped and others feared that judicial limits on federal power might be resuscitated in Gonzales v. Oregon and Rapanos v. United States, the two most significant federalism cases of the 2005-2006 term. Oregon and Gonzales could potentially have constrained the virtually limitless Commerce Clause power that the Supreme Court allowed the federal government to claim in Raich. A less high-profile case, Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, addressed the scope of Congress' power to set conditions on grants to state governments under the Spending Clause. Although the federal government suffered setbacks in all three cases, none of them actually impose significant constitutional limitations on congressional power.    
Oregon, Rapanos, and Arlington all involved challenges to assertions of federal regulatory authority that might run afoul of ""clear statement rules."" These doctrines require Congress to clearly indicate its intent in the text of a statute before courts can interpret it in a way that ""raises constitutional problems,"" impinges on an area of traditional state authority, or imposes conditions on state governments that accept federal funds.    
Part I briefly reviews the Raich decision and explains how it opened the door to virtually unlimited federal power under the Commerce Clause. I also discuss a parallel precedent that gave Congress equally unconstrained power under the Spending Clause, Sabri v. United States.    
Part II shows that the major federalism cases of the 2005-2006 term fail to impose any constitutional limits on federal power, and also do not extend the reach of clear statement rules. Thus, the legacy of Raich remains intact. Indeed, all three decisions actually reinforce that legacy by emphasizing that Congress has the power to regulate almost any activity, but merely failed to exert it to the utmost in these specific instances.    
Part III argues that clear statement rules are neither a viable nor an adequate substitute for substantive judicial limits on federal power. Raich poses a serious threat to the longterm viability of federalism clear statement rules. If congressional Commerce Clause authority is virtually unlimited, it is difficult to see how any assertion of that power can trigger a clear statement requirement by raising constitutional problems or by impinging on a policy area reserved to the states.    
The last section of Part III shows that clear statement rules are an inadequate substitute for judicial enforcement of substantive limits on federal power. Clear statement rules sometimes protect the interests of state governments, but that is very different from protecting constitutional federalism. Indeed, state governments will often find it in their interest to support the expansion of federal power; courts applying clear statement rules cannot prevent this. In some situations, Judicial enforcement of clear statement rules might even give state governments additional incentives to promote the enlargement of federal authority.

	",336.0,"The efficient markets hypothesis states that in highly competitive and developed markets it is impossible to derive a trading strategy that can generate persistent excess profits after correction for risk and transaction costs. Andrew Lo, in the introduction of Paul Cootner's ""The Random Character of Stock Prices"" (2000 reprint, p.xi), suggests even to extend the definition of efficient markets so that profits accrue only to those who acquire and maintain a competitive advantage. Then, those profits may simply be the fair reward for unusual skill, extraordinary effort or breakthroughs in financial technology. The goal of this thesis is to test the weak form of the efficient markets hypothesis by applying a broad range of technical trading strategies to a large number of different data sets. In particular, we focus on the question whether, after correcting for transaction costs, risk and data snooping, technical trading rules have statistically significant forecasting power and can generate economically significant profits.    
In Chapter 2, a large set of 5350 trend-following technical trading rules is applied to the price series of cocoa futures contracts traded at the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) and the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE), in the period January 1983 through June 1997. The trading rule set is also applied to the Pound-Dollar exchange rate in the same period. It is found that 58% of the trading rules generate a strictly positive excess return, even if a correction is made for transaction costs, when applied to the LIFFE cocoa futures prices. Moreover, a large set of trading rules exhibits statistically significant forecasting power if applied to the LIFFE cocoa futures series. On the other hand, the same set of strategies performs poor on the CSCE cocoa futures prices, with only 12% generating strictly positive excess returns and hardly showing any statistically significant forecasting power. Bootstrap techniques reveal that the good results found for the LIFFE cocoa futures price series cannot be explained by several popular null models like a random walk, autoregressive and GARCH model, but can be explained by a structural break in trend model. The large difference in the performance of technical trading may be attributed to a combination of the demand/supply mechanism in the cocoa market and an accidental influence of the Pound-Dollar exchange rate, reinforcing trends in the LIFFE cocoa futures but weakening trends in the CSCE cocoa futures. Furthermore, our case study suggests a connection between the success or failure of technical trading and the relative magnitudes of trend, volatility and autocorrelation of the underlying series.    
In the next three chapters, Chapters 3-5, a set of trend-following technical trading rules is applied to the price history of several stocks and stock market indices. Two different performance measures are used to select the best technical trading strategy, namely the mean return and the Sharpe ratio criterion. Corrections are made for transaction costs. If technical trading shows to be profitable, then it could be the case that these profits are merely the reward for bearing the risk of implementing technical trading. Therefore Sharpe-Lintner capital asset pricing models (CAPMs) are estimated to test this hypothesis. Furthermore, if technical trading shows economically and statistically significant forecasting power after corrections are made for transaction costs and risk, then it is tested whether the selected technical trading strategy is genuinely superior to the buy-and-hold benchmark also after a correction is made for data snooping. Tests utilized to correct for data snooping are White's (2000) Reality Check (RC) and Hansen's (2001) test for superior predictive ability (SPA). Finally, it is tested with a recursively optimizing and testing method whether technical trading shows true out-of-sample forecasting power. For example, recursively at the beginning of each month, the strategy with the highest performance during the preceding six months is selected to generate trading signals in that month.    
In Chapter 3, a set of 787 trend-following technical trading rules is applied to the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and to 34 stocks listed in the DJIA in the period January 1973 through June 2001. Because numerous research papers found that technical trading rules show economically and statistically significant forecasting power in the era until 1987, but not in the period thereafter, we split our sample in two subperiods: 1973-1986 and 1987-2002. For the mean return, as well as the Sharpe ratio selection criterion, it is found that in all periods for each data series a technical trading rule can be found that is capable of beating the buy-and-hold benchmark, even if a correction is made for transaction costs. Furthermore, if no transaction costs are implemented, then for most data series it is found by estimating Sharpe-Lintner CAPMs that technical trading generates risk-corrected excess returns over the risk-free interest rate. However, as transaction costs increase the null hypothesis that technical trading rule profits are just the reward for bearing risk is not rejected for more and more data series. Moreover, if as little as 0.25% transaction costs are implemented, then the null hypothesis that the best technical trading strategy found in a data set is not superior to the buy-and-hold benchmark after a correction is made for data snooping, is neither rejected by the RC nor by the SPA-test for all data series examined. Finally, the recursive optimizing and testing method does not show economically and statistically significant risk-corrected out-of-sample forecasting power of technical trading. Thus, in this chapter, no evidence is found that trend-following technical trading rules can forecast the direction of the future price path of the DJIA and stocks listed in the DJIA.    
In Chapter 4, the same technical trading rule set is applied to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange Index (AEX-index) and to 50 stocks listed in the AEX-index in the period January 1983 through May 2002. For both selection criteria, it is found that for each data series a technical trading strategy can be selected that is capable of beating the buy-and-hold benchmark, also after correction for transaction costs. Furthermore, by estimating Sharpe-Lintner CAPMs, it is found for both selection criteria in the presence of 1% transaction costs that for approximately half of the data series the best technical trading strategy has statistically significant risk-corrected forecasting power and even reduces risk of trading. Next, a correction is made for data snooping by applying the RC and the SPA-test. If the mean return criterion is used for selecting the best strategy, then both tests lead for almost all data series to the same conclusion if as little as 0.10% transaction costs are implemented, namely that the best technical trading strategy selected by the mean return criterion is not capable of beating the buy-and-hold benchmark after correcting for the specification search that is used to select the best strategy. In contrast, if the Sharpe ratio selection criterion is used, then for one third of the data series the null of no superior forecasting power is rejected by the SPA-test, even after correction for 1% transaction costs. Thus, in contrast to the findings for the stocks listed in the DJIA in Chapter 3, we find that technical trading has economically and statistically significant forecasting power for a group of stocks listed in the AEX-index, after a correction is made for transaction costs, risk and data snooping, if the Sharpe ratio criterion is used for selecting the best technical trading strategy. Finally, the recursive optimizing and testing method does show out-of-sample forecasting profits of technical trading. Estimation of Sharpe-Lintner CAPMs shows, after correction for 0.10% transaction costs, that the best recursive optimizing and testing method has statistically significant risk-corrected forecasting power for more than $40\%$ of the data series examined. However, if transaction costs increase to 0.50% per trade, then for almost all data series the best recursive optimizing and testing procedure has no statistically significant risk-corrected forecasting power anymore. Thus, only for sufficiently low transaction costs technical trading is economically and statistically significant for a group of stocks listed in the AEX-index.    
In Chapter 5, the set of 787 trend-following technical trading strategies is applied to 50 local main stock market indices in Africa, North and South America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific, and to the MSCI World Index in the period January 1981 through June 2002. We consider the case of a U.S.-based trader and recompute all profits in U.S. Dollars. It is found that half of the indices could not even beat a continuous risk-free investment. However, as in Chapters 3 and 4, it is found for both selection criteria that for each stock market index a technical trading strategy can be selected that is capable of beating the buy-and-hold benchmark, also after correction for transaction costs. Furthermore, after implementing 1% costs per trade, still for half of the indices a statistically significant risk-corrected forecasting power is found by estimating CAPMs. If also a correction is made for data snooping, then we find, as in Chapter 4, that both selection criteria yield different results. In the presence of 0.50% transaction costs, the null hypothesis of no superior predictive ability of the best technical trading strategy selected by the mean return criterion over the buy-and-hold benchmark after correcting for the specification search is not rejected for most indices by both the RC and SPA-test. However, if the Sharpe ratio criterion is used to select the best strategy, then for one fourth of the indices, mainly the Asian ones, the null hypothesis of no superior forecastability is rejected by the SPA-test, even in the presence of 1% transaction costs. Finally, the recursive optimizing and testing method does show out-of-sample forecasting profits, also in the presence of transaction costs, mainly for the Asian, Latin American, Middle East and Russian stock market indices. However, for the U.S., Japanese and most Western European stock market indices the recursive out-of-sample forecasting procedure does not show to be profitable, after implementing little transaction costs. Moreover, for sufficiently high transaction costs it is found, by estimating CAPMs, that technical trading shows no statistically significant risk-corrected out-of-sample forecasting power for almost all of the stock market indices. Only for low transaction costs (<=0.25% per trade) economically and statistically significant risk-corrected out-of-sample forecasting power of trend-following technical trading techniques is found for the Asian, Latin American, Middle East and Russian stock market indices.    
In Chapter 6, a financial market model with heterogeneous adaptively learning agents is developed. The agents can choose between a fundamental forecasting rule and a technical trading rule. The fundamental forecasting rule predicts that the price returns back to the fundamental value with a certain speed, whereas the technical trading rule is based on moving averages. The model in this chapter extends the Brock and Hommes (1998) heterogeneous agents model by adding a moving-average technical trading strategy to the set of beliefs the agents can choose from, but deviates by assuming constant relative risk aversion, so that agents choosing the same forecasting rule invest the same fraction of their wealth in the risky asset. The local dynamical behavior of the model around the fundamental steady state is studied by varying the values of the model parameters. A mixture of theoretical and numerical methods is used to analyze the dynamics. In particular, we show that the fundamental steady state may become unstable due to a Hopf bifurcation. The interaction between fundamentalists and technical traders may thus cause prices to deviate from their fundamental value. In this heterogeneous world, the fundamental traders are not able to drive the moving average traders out of the market, but fundamentalists and technical analysts coexist forever with their relative importance changing over time.

Half of this gain disappears over the next five years as other retail establishments exit and contract, leaving a long-run statistically significant net gain of 50 jobs. Wholesale employment declines by approximately 20 jobs due to Wal-Mart's vertical integration.

	",95.0,"Although you can find it just about everywhere, the twenty-first century supermarket is hard to define. Consumers have no need to define them They tend to visit these huge and efficient emporia weekly or more often, and they know they can buy what they need there. That's all they need to know. Transactional lawyers who specialize in lease negotiations can't think of the supermarket solely as a place where they can buy food and other things. Defining the supermarket and distinguishing supermarkets  from other kinds of stores that do business in shopping centers are essential skills for them. To a large degree, a shopping center's success depends on the diversity of its tenant-mix. Consumers are drawn to shopping centers that offer a wide variety of merchandise, and shopping centers that can't do that are left behind in this competitive world. That's why shopping center landlords and tenants alike favor contractual arrangements to assure tenant mix diversity. We find these contractual arrangements in leases in the form of clauses called use clauses that regulate the business conducted in the leased stores and exclusive  clauses that regulate the business conducted in the other stores of the  shopping center. A use clause might prohibit the tenant from conducting any business in its leased premises other than a supermarket, and an exclusive clause might prohibit the landlord from leasing any other space in the shopping center to a competing supermarket.    
It follows then that a lease negotiator must understand what a supermarket is - especially if he or she proposes or accepts a use clause limiting the use of a store to a supermarket or an exclusive prohibiting other stores from being used a supermarket. Only uncertainty, disappointment, and bitter litigation can result from a failure to understand just what kind of a store a supermarket is.    
This article, the first in a series of five articles, defines the  supermarket by exploring the industry's historic roots. It reviews the innovative business plan conceived by the industry's founding father. It illustrates how the founding father's plan was modified by feisty entrepreneurs who followed in his footsteps and added their own improvements to the institution destined to completely revamp the world's food distribution system.

	",29.0,"Our thesis is that the assessment of a legal policy should depend exclusively on its effects on human welfare, that is, on the well-being of individuals. In particular, no independent evaluative weight should be accorded to notions of fairness, such as corrective justice in tort and desert in punishment. (Concerns about the distribution of income are not, however, subject to our critique.) When the choice of legal rules is influenced by notions of fairness, individuals are often made worse off. Indeed, if the prescriptions of any notion of fairness are followed, it is always possible that everyone will be made worse off. Moreover, when we examine notions of fairness and the literature that advances them, we are unable to identify reasons that, on reflection, justify giving weight to these notions at the expense of individuals' well-being.    
Nevertheless, notions of fairness are widely felt to be appealing. We suggest that this appeal can largely be explained by three factors: notions of fairness often correspond to social norms that usefully regulate everyday life; notions of fairness may serve as proxy devices for achieving instrumental objectives; and individuals may have a taste for satisfaction of the notions. However, we explain that none of these factors warrants employing notions of fairness as independent evaluative principles in the assessment of legal policy.    
We develop these arguments through consideration of specific conceptions of fairness that are employed in major areas of law: tort, contract, legal procedure, and law enforcement. We also discuss the implications of our analysis for our primary audience, legal academics and other legal policy analysts, and also for government officials, notably legislators, regulators, and judges.

Speeding tickets are not only determined by the speed of the offender, but by incentives faced by police officers and their vote maximizing principals. Our model predicts that police officers issue higher fines when drivers have a higher opportunity cost of contesting a ticket, and when drivers do not reside in the community where they are stopped. The model also predicts that local officers are more likely to issue a ticket when legal limits prevent the local government from increasing revenues though other instruments such as property taxes. We find support for the hypotheses. The farther the residence of a driver from the municipality where the ticket could be contested, the higher is the likelihood of a fine and the larger its' amount. The probability of a fine issued by a local officer is higher in towns when constraints on increasing property taxes are binding, the property tax base is lower, and the town is less dependent on revenues from tourism. For state troopers, who are not employed by the local, but rather the state government, we do not find evidence that the likelihood of traffic fines varies with town characteristics. Finally, personal characteristics, such as gender and race, are among the determinants of traffic fines.

	",49.0,"This paper uses the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) to analyse the dynamics of moonlighting by the working-age population. We find that moonlighting is transitory and that a desire to switch jobs expressed in the past is positively related to moonlighting in the present and to actual job changes in the future. We also find that workers who moonlighted as self-employed in the past represent 26.5 percent of the new self-employed. These results suggest that moonlighting in Russia can be seen as an effective incubator for setting up new self-employed businesses, thereby providing long-term benefits for the economy.

	",91.0,"Prospect theory scholars have identified important human decision-making biases, but they have been conspicuously silent on the question of the origin of these biases.  Here we create a model that shows preferences consistent with prospect theory may have an origin in evolutionary psychology. Specifically, we derive a model from risk-sensitive optimal foraging theory to generate an explanation for the origin and function of context-dependent risk aversion and risk seeking behavior. Although this model suggests that human cognitive architecture evolved to solve particular adaptive problems related to finding sufficient food resources to survive, we argue that this same architecture persists and is utilized in other survival-related decisions that are critical to understanding political outcomes. In particular, we identify important departures from standard results when we incorporate prospect theory into theories of spatial voting and legislator behavior, international bargaining and conflict, and economic development and reform.

	",96.0,"Our purpose is to provide a review of the development of the modern theory of corporate finance. Through the early 1950s the finance literature consisted in large part of ad hoc theories. Dewing (1919; 1953) the major corporate finance textbook for a generation, contains much institutional detail but little systematic analysis. It starts with the birth of a corporation and follows it through various policy decisions to its death (bankruptcy). Corporate financial theory prior to the 1950s was riddled with logical inconsistencies and was almost totally prescriptive, that is, normatively oriented. The major concerns of the field were optimal investment, financing, and dividend policies, but little consideration was given to the effect on these policies of individual incentives, or to the nature of equilibrium in financial markets.    
The logical structure of decision-making implies that better answers to normative questions are likely to occur when the decision maker has a richer set of positive theories that provide a better understanding of the consequences of his or her choices. This important relation between normative and positive theories often goes unrecognized. Purposeful decisions cannot be made without the explicit or implicit use of positive theories. You cannot decide what action to take and expect to meet your objective if you have no idea about how alternative actions affect the desired outcome - and that is what is meant by a positive theory. For example, to choose among alternative financial structures, a manager wants to know how the choices affect expected net cash flows, their riskiness, and therefore how they affect firm value. Using incorrect positive theories leads to decisions that have unexpected and undesirable outcomes.    
In reviewing the development of the theory of corporative finance we begin in Section 2 with a brief summary of the major theoretical building blocks of financial economics. The major areas of corporate financial policy - capital budgeting, capital structure, and dividend policy - are discussed in Sections 3 through 5.

	",22.0,"Racial profiling of drivers - often called ""driving while black"" - has taken an increasingly important role in the public debate on issues of race and criminal justice.  It is one of the few such issues that has penetrated not only the public discourse, but the legislative process as well.       This article takes three different approaches in attempting to explain that racial profiling is important not only for its own sake, but because it is a manifestation - both a symbol and a symptom - of all of the most difficult problems that we face at the intersection of race and criminal justice.  First, the stories of a number of African Americans, selected not for their egregiousness but for their typicality, are used to illustrate the personal pain, humiliation, and anguish racial profiling inflicts on individual people of color.  Second, the article marshalls statistical evidence, including the author's own study of four metropolitan areas in Ohio, to show that profiling is not an exaggeration of a few isolated incidents into a social trend, but a real and measurable phenomenon.  Third, the bulk of the article aims to show how racial profiling is connected to many of the different issues of race and criminal justice that are on the table today, such as stereotypes of black criminality, rational discrimination by law enforcement, and disproportionate rates of imprisonment among blacks, to name a few.  The upshot of the analysis is that ""driving while black"" may serve as a way for many in the majority to begin to come to grips with issues of race and criminal justice in ways that they have not before.

	",25.0,"This paper presents estimates indicating that, for aggregate U.S. stock market data 1871-1986, a long historical average of real earnings is a good predictor of the present value of future real dividends. This is true even when the information contained in stock prices is taken into account. We estimate that for each year the optimal forecast of the present value of future real dividends is roughly a weighted average of moving average earnings and current real price, with between 2/3 and 3/4 of the weight on the earnings measure. This means that simple present value models of stock prices can be strongly rejected. We use a vector autoregressive approach which enables us to compute the implications of this for the behavior of stock prices and returns. We estimate that log dividend-price ratios are more variable than, and virtually uncorrelated with, their theoretical counterparts given the present value models. Annual returns on stocks are quite highly correlated with their theoretical counterparts, but are two to four times as variable. Our approach also reveals the connection between recent papers showing forecastability of long-horizon returns on corporate stocks, and earlier literature claiming that stock prices are too volatile to be accounted for in terms of simple present value models. We show that excess volatility directly implies the forecastability of long-horizon returns.

But what, if any, is the value of control in a firm, and if it exists, how do we go about estimating it? In this paper, we examine the ingredients of the control premium. In particular, we argue that the value of controlling a firm has to lie in being able to run it differently (and better). Consequently, the value of control will be greater for poorly managed firms than well run ones. The value of control has wide ranging implications beyond acquisitions. We show that the expected likelihood of control changing is built into the price of every publicly traded company and that this provides a way of measuring the payoff to strong corporate governance. We also argue that getting a better handle on the value of control can allow us to better explain the differences between voting and non-voting share prices and the minority discount in private company valuations.

	",32.0,"Although the Ninth Amendment appears on its face to protect unenumerated individual rights of the same sort as those that were enumerated in the Bill of Rights, courts and scholars have long deprived it of any relevance to constitutional adjudication. With the growing interest in originalist methods of interpretation since the 1980s, however, this situation has changed. In the past twenty years, five originalist models of the Ninth Amendment have been propounded by scholars: the state law rights model, the residual rights model, the individual natural rights model, the collective rights model, and the federalism model. This Article examines thirteen crucial pieces of historical evidence that either directly contradict the state law and residual rights models, undercut the collective rights model, or strongly support the individual natural rights and federalism models. Evaluating the five models in light of this evidence establishes that the Ninth Amendment actually meant at the time of its enactment what it appears now to say: the unenumerated (natural) rights that people possessed prior to the formation of government, and which they retain afterwards, should be treated in the same manner as those (natural) rights that were enumerated in the Bill of Rights. In short, the Amendment is what it appears to be: a meaningful check on federal power and a significant guarantee of individual liberty.

	",22.0,"As recent incidents in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and other disasters have illustrated, the moral content of looting spans a wide continuum: At one end are predatory and exploitative acts that seem deserving of even greater punishment than ordinary acts of burglary and larceny.  At the other end are cases of necessity, involving otherwise law-abiding citizens who, as a result of forces beyond their control, find themselves hungry and exposed to the elements.  In between these two poles lies a wide range of conduct that often involves impoverished and alienated citizens living on the edges of society, encouraged to engage in lawlessness by powerful group dynamics and the apparent suspension of civil order.     
This article begins by examining the various meanings - both literal and metaphorical - of looting. It then considers the factors that make bad looting so bad, and good looting less so. With respect to the latter, it considers the possibility that: (1) the disruption in normal social order might leave defendants in a state of nature, outside the jurisdictional reach of the court; (2) the defendant's criminal acts were necessary to avoid some greater harm from occurring; and (3) the otherwise law-abiding offender, suffering from a combination of fright, fatigue, hunger, exposure, and disorientation, should be at least partially excused on the grounds that his acts were out of character.     
The article concludes by considering some of the practical implications of the foregoing analysis, including the suggestion by various commentators that the proper response to looters is to shoot them on sight. It argues that such a policy would be profoundly misguided, both because the criminal law should not tolerate the disproportionate use of deadly force in response to what is essentially a property crime, and because of the obvious difficulties of distinguishing between bad and good looting, particularly under the kinds of emergency conditions in which such acts are committed.

John Rawls has famously said that justice is the first virtue of social and legal institutions.  This lecture seeks to open a discussion of the question: What would law - particularly criminal law - be like if we regarded love (agape) as the first virtue of social and legal institutions?  The lecture discusses punishment - including capital punishment - in a framework of love, and critically considers the claim frequently made that love-based forgiveness is inconsistent with capital punishment and perhaps with all punishment.

In the decades after the Civil War, southern states attempted to prevent African-Americans from migrating by passing emigrant agent laws. These laws essentially banned interstate labor recruitment. The Supreme Court upheld emigrant agent laws in the little-known case of Williams v. Fears in 1900. The history of emigrant agent laws provides evidence that: (1) state action played a larger role in discrimination against African-Americans than is generally acknowledged; (2) laissez-faire jurisprudence was potentially helpful to disenfranchised African-Americans; and (3) the federalist structure of the U.S. provided African-Americans with opportunities to improve their lot through internal migration.

The predominance of the public sector in the supply of water was not always the case, however; private firms dominated U.S. water supply throughout most of the 19th century.  This paper analyzes the puzzle of why water and sanitation systems were the only major utilities to become predominantly public by, first, re-examining historical accounts of the problems of contracting for water services in light of modern theories of economic organization and, then, evaluating hypotheses derived from those accounts using data on 373 waterworks serving U.S. municipalities with populations over 10,000 in 1890.  Among other results, municipal ownership is found to be related to the distribution of population and commerce within a city in ways that suggest that frictions between cities and private companies over system extensions and improvements played a significant role in the shift to municipal ownership.

Trust is positively associated with the respondent's education, and negatively associated with the amount of time spent commuting. At a neighbourhood level, trust is higher in affluent areas, and lower in ethnically and linguistically heterogeneous communities, with the effect being stronger for linguistic heterogeneity than ethnic heterogeneity. Linguistic heterogeneity reduces localised trust for both natives and immigrants, and reduces generalised trust only for immigrants. Instrumental variables specifications show similar results. In contrast to the USA, there is no apparent relationship between trust and inequality across neighbourhoods in Australia.

Most significantly, Sunstein and Thaler neglect alternative approaches to dealing with irrational choice behavior that are more consistent with libertarian principles and that make choice-framing paternalism evitable, they would subjugate the liberty of irrational individuals to a central planner's paternalistic welfare judgments, and they fail to deal with the redistributive consequences of libertarian paternalism. Libertarian paternalism, as currently formulated, is not designed to liberate individuals from their irrational tendencies but to capitalize on irrational tendencies to move citizens in directions that the paternalistic planner deems best. Libertarian paternalism does leave rational persons a way out of the central planner's paternalism, but often the exit will not be costless, as the paternalistic costs of trying to improve the welfare of irrational persons are shifted to the rational persons. While fidelity to libertarian principles leaves little room for the government to regulate irrational behavior, there are some forms of irrationality regulation more congenial to libertarian principles than Sunstein and Thaler's version of libertarian paternalism, examples of which are discussed here.

	",18.0,"The traditional view in economics is that individuals respond to incentives, but absent strong incentives to the contrary selfishness prevails.  Moreover, this ""greed is good"" approach is deemed ""rational"" behavior.  Nevertheless, in daily interactions and in numerous laboratory studies, a high degree of cooperative behavior prevails - even among strangers.  A possible explanation for the substantial amount of ""irrational"" behavior observed in markets (and elsewhere) is that humans are a highly social species and to an extent value what other humans think of them.  This behavior can be termed trustworthiness - cooperating when someone places trust in us. I also present the cross-country evidence for environments that produce high or low trust.   A number of recent experiments from my lab have demonstrated that the neuroactive hormone oxytocin facilitates trust between strangers, and appears to induce trustworthiness.  In rodents, oxytocin has been associated with maternal bonding, pro-social behaviors, and in some species long-term pair bonds, but prior to the work reviewed here, the behavioral effects of oxytocin in humans had not been studied.  This chapter discusses the neurobiology of positive social behaviors and how these are facilitated by oxytocin.   My experiments show that positive social signals cause oxytocin to be released by the brain, producing an unconscious attachment to a stranger.  I also discuss recent research that manipulates oxytocin levels, and functional brain imaging research on trust.

	",,"Maurice Allais's view that the credit created by fractional reserve banking is equivalent to counterfeiting has led him to recommend the separation of the depository and lending functions of banks. This proposal has recently been reintroduced by James Tobin and others under the term ""narrow banking."" Proponents cite the potential for enhanced safety of the payments mechanism and the elimination of costs associated with the preses system of Federal deposit insurance. This plan resembles the ""100% reserves"" and ""100% money"" proposals submitted by Irving Fisher, Henry Simons, and others in the 1930s.    
The essence of banking today is that banks borrow short and lend long, while Allais's proposal would require the reverse: borrow long and lend short. Among Allais's objections to the fractional reserve system are the creation and destruction of money by private banks, the impossibility of control over the credit system, and the lack of efficient control of the aggregate money supply. The fundamental principles guiding reform are that (i) the creation of money should be the business of only the state, and (ii) no money should be created outside the monetary base, so that no one would be entitled to the benefits that attach to the creation of bank money. A corollary to this proposal is that the availability of credit is limited to just what the private sector is willing to lend on an equity basis.    
Phillips addresses the common shortcomings of previous reform proposals (e.g. Peel's Act of 1844 and 100% reserve plans of the 1930s), which failed to recognize the existence of substitutes to  banknotes and demand deposits. The lingering question is how to ""construct financial institutions which do not impede the development of the economy, yet are flexible enough to allow for technological innovation and market discipline."" Narrow banking is a response (though not a panacea) to this dilemma, which clarifies the fundamental principles involved and ""allows a way out of the Federal deposit insurance mess.""

	",,"Although the United States and Canada have had quite different constitutional frameworks, their uses of emergency powers through most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were very similar. In the nineteenth century, national troops were used to put down local rebellions in both countries, often at the request of local governors. With World War I, however, both moved to a statute-based system of regulating emergencies. In Canada, the War Powers Act provided broad delegations of power from the parliament to the executive. In the U.S., delegations were also broad, but accomplished through a series of smaller statutes. These frameworks lasted until abuses of emergency powers were exposed in both countries in the 1970s. And there the parallel history ended. Canada adopted a comprehensive constitutional revision that brought all emergency powers within constitutional understandings. The U.S., on the other hand, continued its use of statutory patches to regulate the relationship between the executive and legislature in times of crisis. As a result, the reactions of the two countries to the events of 9/11 were quite different. Canada responded with a moderate use of exceptional powers, while the US plunged into more extreme uses of emergency powers.

	",20.0,"This paper examines the overall economics of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, in three main parts. The first part explores the structure of the Protocol and how this matches against classical economic criteria of an 'optimal' climate change agreement. This discussion also considers the nature of and reasons for shortcomings, and the prospects for its evolution. Given the various flexibilities in the agreement, the Kyoto Protocol is far more economically efficient in its structure than any previous global environmental agreement. The central conclusion is that, from an economic perspective, the Protocol's structure for industrialised country commitments is as good as could reasonably be expected. The second part of the paper explores more closely the economics of the commitments themselves and how they combine with the various flexibilities, briefly reviewing the available literature and using a simple spreadsheet model of how the commitments might combine with trading mechanisms under a range of assumptions. Flexibility is intrinsic and necessary, but it is argued that the allocations to Russia and Ukraine in particular mean that unlimited flexibility could render the Protocol's commitments weaker in their impacts than is economically desirable to address climate change. It is argued that, should this prove to be the case, access to the large surplus in the transition economies could be used as a control valve to limit the costs of the Protocol to within acceptable limits. Finally, the paper considers the issues of developing country involvement in the Kyoto Protocol, and the Protocol's longer-term impact and evolution, including its impact on technological evolution and dissemination and the evolution of future commitments. It is argued that taking account of such issues critically affects views of the Protocol.

	",59.0,"This article is a detailed examination of ethical cultivation as it occurs in the Debian project, whose volunteers produce a non-commercial distribution of the GNU/Linux OS.  Thus far, much of the literature on free and open source software (F/OSS) production has been heavily focused on the question of motivation or incentive mechanisms and has tended to ignore how hacker valuations, motivations, and commitments are transformed by the lived experiences that unfold in F/OSS projects and institutions that are mediated through project charters and organizational procedures.  In this anthropological piece, I draw heavily on the work of the legal theorist Robert Cover (1992), who examines the ways in which ""jurigenisis,"" the production and stabilization of inhabited normative and legal meanings, requires an ongoing and sometimes conflicting narrative interpretation of codified textual norms.  I specify his model in examining how three different ethical moments are the grounds for the adoption, transformation, and re-evaluation of a set of values related to accountability, freedom, transparency, openness, and mutual aid: conflict-free enculturation, legal pedagogy and production, and lastly crisis.

	",112.0,"A common argument against privatization is that private providers will self-interestedly lobby to increase the size of their market. In this Article, I evaluate this argument, using, as a case study, the argument against prison privatization based on the possibility that the private prison industry will distort the criminal law by advocating for incarceration.    
I conclude that there is at present no particular reason to credit this argument. Even without privatization, actors in the public sector already lobby for changes in substantive law â€” in the prison context, for example, public corrections officer unions are active advocates of pro-incarceration policy. Against this background, adding the â€œextra voiceâ€ of the private sector will not necessarily increase either the amount of industry-increasing advocacy or its effectiveness. In fact, privatization may well reduce the industryâ€™s political power: Because advocacy is a â€œpublic goodâ€ for the industry, as the number of independent actors increases, the dominant actorâ€™s advocacy can decrease (since it no longer captures the full benefit of its advocacy) and the other actors may free ride off the dominant actorâ€™s contribution. Under some plausible assumptions, therefore, privatization may actually decrease advocacy. Under different plausible assumptions, the net effect of privatization on advocacy is ambiguous, but in any event, privatization does not unambiguously increase advocacy. The argument that privatization distorts policy by encouraging lobbying is thus unconvincing without a fuller explanation of the mechanics of advocacy.

	",5.0,"This article discusses the United States Supreme Court's June 25, 2007, decision in the First Amendment student speech case, Morse v. Frederick, in conjunction with the Court's three prior student speech cases (known as the Tinker trilogy).   I have three goals in this article.  First, I aim to clarify the Court's student speech doctrine.  The Tinker trilogy has received substantial scholarly attention, but that scholarship has resulted in little consensus.  Courts have been as puzzled as commentators, and have issued many inconsistent opinions.  This article picks up where the pre-Morse commentators left off, and considers the Court's school speech precedent as a whole, thereby revealing a more coherent doctrinal framework.     
Second, I discuss the appropriate inquiry for courts to use when  evaluating a school's regulation of student speech mentioning illegal drugs.  The test, which focuses on whether the speech has a political message, is not only consistent with Morse, but also would arguably be supported by eight of the nine sitting Justices.      
Third, I propose a four-part conditional test for courts to use when evaluating a school's regulation of any student speech (that is, whether or not it mentions illegal drugs).      
The four-part test provides an efficient, practical, and analytically sound way for courts to analyze schools' regulation of student speech, and to do so without considering more constitutional issues than necessary.  And, the four-part test balances the Court's competing concerns of giving leeway to schools to maintain discipline and of protecting students' core First Amendment rights. "," Morse v.

	",234.0,"This article explores ways in which the current delegation of sensitive military responsibilities to private contractors threatens to (1) violate the constitutional imperatives of limited and democratic government, (2) undermine the institutional excellence of the U.S. Armed Forces, and (3) jeopardize the already shaky diplomatic and moral standing of the United States in the eyes of the rest of the world.  	    
Military privatization of combat duties could be used (and perhaps already has) to allow the Executive to operate in the shadows of public attention, domestic and international laws, and even to circumvent congressional oversight.  For a variety of political and legal reasons, the Executive might at times be constrained in deploying U.S. soldiers.  The public's aversion to a military draft (and squeamishness about soldier casualties), the international community's disdain for American unilateralism, and Congress's reluctance to endorse an administration's hawkish foreign goals might each serve to inhibit the president's ability to use U.S. troops in a given zone of conflict.     In those instances, it would not necessarily be the cheaper price tag or specialized expertise that makes contractors desirable.  Rather, it might very well be the status of the actors (as private, non-governmental agents) vis-a-vis public opinion, congressional scrutiny, and international law that entices policymakers to turn to contracting.      
Accordingly, this article has two sets of aims.  On the immediate level, I argue that the privatization of military functions poses a slew of problems too complicated and varied to resolve simply by enhancing accountability controls, strengthening contract laws, and ratcheting up contractor liability.  And, more generally, I suggest that military contracting of this sort challenges the conventional wisdom of American privatization policy, which understands decisions to outsource overwhelmingly in economic, cost-saving terms.

	",3.0,"Professor Litman  has written Digital Copyright for the general public, though lawyers, and especially copyright lawyers, would do well to read it.  Professor Litman's message is straightforward: Copyright law is too complicated and counterintuitive.  It has been written by and for copyright lawyers who represent many, but not all, of the players.  Those left out include developers of new ways of communicating copyrighted works, and, most importantly, end users.  But nowadays, copyright directly affects end users in ways more pervasive than could have been expected in the analog world.  If copyright law doesn't make sense to those who are supposed to adhere to it, copyright will cease to be a meaningful constraint on users' activities. This review first briefly addresses Professor Litman's evocation of the copyright law-making process.  Her discussion of legislative history presents a valuable and compelling account, especially for those unfamiliar with copyright law.  But the most provocative portions of the book, to which this review will devote most attention, are the chapters in which Professor Litman (a) reviews and challenges various metaphors for copyright policy (Chapter 5, ""Choosing Metaphors""); (b) in which she recounts the rocky relationship between copyright owners and developers of new technological means of disseminating works (Chapter 10, ""The Copyright Wars""); and (c) in which she offers her own prescription for a simple, fair and workable copyright law (Chapter 12, ""Revising Copyright Law for the Information Age""). Digital Copyright will not dispel disagreements about copyright's goals and proper scope; but because Professor Litman is such an effective advocate, she forces ""copyright optimists"" (such as this reviewer) to think harder about whether strong copyright protection remains desirable. This review therefore endeavors not only to present Professor Litman's arguments, but to offer some reasons for resistence to some of those claims.

Even Brian Leiter, who seeks to defend the realists against Hart, agrees that rule-skepticism fails as a theory of law. Indeed, an essential part of Leiter's rehabilitation of the realists is his argument that they did not mean to offer a theory of law at all.    
This article is a defense of the realists' rule-skepticism as a theory of law. The heart of my argument is that their rule-skepticism was actually an attack, common among philosophical anarchists, on the ability of the law to provide citizens (and particularly judges adjudicating cases) with objective reasons for obedience.

	",24.0,"The evidence from individual cases and from cross-country analysis supports the view that globalization leads to faster growth and poverty reduction in poor countries. To determine the effect of globalization on growth, poverty, and inequality, Dollar and Kraay first identify a group of developing countries that are participating more in globalization. China, India, and several other large countries are part of this group, so well over half the population of the developing world lives in these globalizing economies.    
Over the past 20 years, the post-1980 globalizers have seen large increases in trade and significant declines in tariffs. Their growth rates accelerated between the 1970s and the 1980s and again between the 1980s and the 1990s, even as growth in the rich countries and the rest of the developing world slowed. The post-1980 globalizers are catching up to the rich countries, but the rest of the developing world (the non-globalizers) is falling further behind.    
Next, Dollar and Kraay ask how general these patterns are, using regressions that exploit within-country variations in trade and growth. After controlling for changes in other policies and addressing endogeneity with internal instruments, they find that trade has a strong positive effect on growth.    
Finally, the authors examine the effects of trade on the poor. They find little systematic evidence of a relationship between changes in trade volumes (or any other measure of globalization they consider) and changes in the income share of the poorest - or between changes in trade volumes and changes in household income inequality. They conclude, therefore, that the increase in growth rates that accompanies expanded trade translates on average into proportionate increases in incomes of the poor. Absolute poverty in the globalizing developing economies has fallen sharply in the past 20 years. The evidence from individual cases and from cross-country analysis supports the view that globalization leads to faster growth and poverty reduction in poor countries.    
This paper - a product of Macroeconomics and Growth, Development Research Group - is part of a larger effort in the department to study the effects of globalization on the poor.

	",,"In the international oil market, the producers are cartelized, whereas the buyers are fragmented. As standard economic analysis suggests, this results in a greater share of the surplus for the producers. The cost of exploration plus production for a barrel of oil to the producers is approximately $14, whereas the recent price is $65.     
A buyers' cartel could be formed by the governments of the major oil importing countries like the U.S., Japan, Germany, China, India, France, South Korea etc. All oil sold in these countries would have to pass through the buyers' cartel. The buyers' cartel could negotiate a price with the oil exporting countries, say $20 a barrel (which should be a markup of 43% over costs). After purchasing oil from the producing countries, the buyers' cartel would release the oil in the market and let demand determine the price. If current demand conditions remain unchanged then the price would still remain at $65. However, this would reduce the effective price to the citizens of the importing countries to $20 a barrel as their governments would earn a profit of $45, which could be used to reduce taxes or pay for programs like Social Security. It would also reduce the trade deficit which is a long term risk to the value of the dollar and the US economy.    
For the U.S. (which imports 12.7 million barrels a day) the savings would be $51 x 12.7 million x 365 = $236 billion a year.     
Such a cartel would not be an inefficient interruption of free trade as Ricardo's arguments of specialization do not apply. A country cannot specialize in producing oil just because the price went up, it needs to have oil deposits. In any case the market price of oil is far beyond cost of exploration/production which indicates large rents being earned. A buyers' cartel would simply transfer the rents from the producers to the consumers. For the global economy the cartel would have the effect of a technological innovation that reduces costs, hence leading to greater efficiency and a rise in production. The rents currently being charged by producers increase costs of economic activity and create deadweight losses.     
The buyers' cartel is also morally necessary as the rents (surplus) should belong to the consumers whose efforts led to the economic development that created the rents.     
It would be expected that the governments of the producing nations would resist a buyers' cartel. At the very least the importing countries should be able to negotiate with them to share the surplus 50:50. With such an agreement the savings to the importing countries would be:    
1) US $118 billion a year ( (1/2) x ($65 - $14) x 12.7 million x 365) 2) Japan $50 billion a year 3) China $27 billion a year 4) Germany $22 billion a year 5) South Korea $20 billion a year 6) France $18 billion a year 7) India $14 billion a year    
(Note that the above numbers are only half of the surplus being currently appropriated by the producing countries.)    
The increasing demand for oil by importing countries will keep increasing the surplus (rent). Economists from the investment bank Ixis-CIB predict that by 2015 the price of oil would reach $380 a barrel. Without a buyers' cartel that would result in an outflow of surplus of $1.6 trillion a year from the US (at current consumption levels).

	",47.0,"In this article, we trace the origin and spread of state laws designed to make indigent criminal defendants pay, up-front, a portion of the costs of their state-appointed counsel. These co-pays, which can range from $10 to over $200, are part of the increasingly popular pay-as-you-go movement, requiring criminal defendants to defray the system costs of their prosecution and punishment.     
On their face, such laws would appear to be a natural target of vigorous resistance by the defense bar. This turns out to be only half true, however, for it is often the leaders of public defense organizations, faced with severe budget cuts, who take the lead in advocating for the laws. The leadership encounters resistance from its front-line staff attorneys, who uncompromisingly invoke principles of government responsibility to the poor, and assert that fees will chill defendants' willingness to request a lawyer. Judges also react grudgingly to these laws, either by implementing them slowly or by invalidating them outright.     
This political dynamic reveals a remarkable gap in criminal justice knowledge: the actual number of defendants who waive their legal right to counsel. Both supporters and detractors of the up-front fees make unsupported assumptions about the amount of waiver. We analyze data from two jurisdictions with co-pay laws, Minnesota and North Carolina, and find no sign of increased waiver directly caused by the laws. We then discuss the limitations of the data, and reflect on why public officials do not put more effort into tracking choices of defendants (especially misdemeanor defendants) that have such large effects on the cost and quality of the justice system.

	",54.0,"The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of William Sharpe (1964) and John Lintner (1965) marks the birth of asset pricing theory (resulting in a Nobel Prize for Sharpe in 1990). Before their breakthrough, there were no asset pricing models built from first principles about the nature of tastes and investment opportunities and with clear testable predictions about risk and return. Four decades later, the CAPM is still widely used in applications, such as estimating the cost of equity capital for firms and evaluating the performance of managed portfolios. And it is the centerpiece, indeed often the only asset pricing model taught in MBA level investment courses.    
The attraction of the CAPM is its powerfully simple logic and intuitively pleasing predictions about how to measure risk and about the relation between expected return and risk. Unfortunately, perhaps because of its simplicity, the empirical record of the model is poor - poor enough to invalidate the way it is used in applications. The model's empirical problems may reflect true failings. (It is, after all, just a model.) But they may also be due to shortcomings of the empirical tests, most notably, poor proxies for the market portfolio of invested wealth, which plays a central role in the model's predictions. We argue, however, that if the market proxy problem invalidates tests of the model, it also invalidates most applications, which typically borrow the market proxies used in empirical tests.    
For perspective on the CAPM's predictions about risk and expected return, we begin with a brief summary of its logic. We then review the history of empirical work on the model and what it says about shortcomings of the CAPM that pose challenges to be explained by more complicated models.

	",26.0,"The market maxim ""Sell in May and go away"" is a simple but profitable one. On average, stocks deliver close to zero returns in the six month period from May through October, only giving a risk premium from November through April. This effect, however, has not been widely covered in academic literature. We examine the hypothesis that the seasonal pattern is caused by an optimism cycle. Towards year end, investors start to look towards the new year, often with overly optimistic expectations. This results in attractive returns for stocks. Several months into the year, this initial optimism becomes hard to maintain and the stock market experiences a summer lull. A zero-investment global sector-rotation strategy based on this theory appears to be highly profitable. Global earnings growth revisions also follow a seasonal pattern parallel to that of the stock market. Finally, in a separate analysis for the US stock market, investors' optimism as measured by the initial returns on IPOs almost completely capture the results of the sector-rotation strategy. All these findings support the optimism-cycle hypothesis.

	",37.0,"Many countries that produce rough diamonds have experienced a highly adverse pattern of economic development. In this article, we propose that the primary reason for the negative impact is that diamonds easily become the prize in predatory struggles between loot-seeking rebels and more or less kleptocratic governments. In weakly institutionalised countries like Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone, this theory works well, but it does not explain the impressive growth record of diamond-rich Botswana and Namibia. For a deeper understanding of these countries success, we point at the crucial differences between kimberlite and alluvial mining and the effect of having the world-leading firm De Beers as a partner. Indeed, we argue that in countries like Angola, diamonds can never be a major vehicle for sustained growth, although the ongoing Kimberley process for eliminating conflict diamonds probably has contributed to making several African countries more stable.

Alternative hypotheses are examined with the aid of a New Keynesian model of aggregate demand and inflation determination, estimated on quarterly UK data for 1959-2000.  The model features IS and Phillips curves based on optimising behaviour, and fully incorporates the distinction between detrended output and the output gap stressed by optimising analysis.  Using model simulations as well as information on the real-time views of policy-makers, alternative explanations are tested for the outbreak of inflation in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s.  Inaccurate estimates of the degree of excess demand in the economy are found to have contributed significantly to the outbreak.  But there is also evidence of a major role following from the failure at the time to recognise the importance of monetary policy, as opposed to non-monetary devices, in controlling inflation.

	",4.0,"Within the field of psychometrics, it is widely acknowledged that test-taking speed and reasoning ability are separate abilities with little or no correlation to each other. The LSAT is a univariate test designed to measure reasoning ability; test-taking speed is assumed to be an ancillary variable with a negligible effect on candidate scores. This Article explores the possibility that test-taking speed is variable common to both the LSAT and actual law school exams. This commonality is important because it may serve to increase the predictive validity of the LSAT. The author obtained data from a national and a regional law school and followed the methodology of a typical LSAT validity study, with one important exception: student performance was disaggregated into three distinct testing methods with varying degrees of time pressure: (1) in-class exams, (2) take-home exams, and (3) papers. Consistent with the hypothesis, the data showed that the LSAT was a relatively robust predictor of in-class exams and a relatively weak predictor on take-home exams and papers. In contrast, undergraduate GPA was a relatively stable predictor on all three testing methods.  
The major implication of this study is that the current emphasis on time-pressured law school exams increases the relative importance of the LSAT as an admission criterion. Further, because the performance gap between white and minority students tends to be larger on the LSAT than UGPA (the other important numerical admissions criteria), heavy reliance on time-pressured law school exams is likely to have the indirect effect of making it more difficult for minority students to be admitted through the regular admissions process. The findings of this study also suggest that when speed is used as a variable on law school exams, the type of testing method, independent of knowledge and preparation, can change the ordering (i.e., relative grades) of individual test-takers. The current emphasis on time-pressured exams, therefore, may skew measures of merit in ways that have little theoretical relationship to the actual practice of law. Finally, this study found some preliminary evidence that the performance gap between white and minority students may be smaller on less time-pressured testing methods, including blindgraded take-home exams. Definitive evidence on this issue will require a larger sample size.

	",,"Since 1960 the mutual fund industry has grown from 160 funds and $18 billion in assets under management to over 8,000 funds with $10.4 trillion in assets.  Yet critics - including Yale Chief Investment Officer David Swensen, Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, and New York Governor Eliot Spitzer - call for more fund regulation, claiming that competition has not protected investors from excessive fees.  Starting in 2003, the number of class action suits against fund advisors increased sharply, and, consistent with critics' views, some courts have excluded or treated skeptically evidence of competition and comparable fees of other funds.  Skepticism about fund competition dates to the 1960s, when the SEC accepted the view that market forces fail to constrain advisory fees, in part because fund boards rarely fire advisors.  In this article, we show that economic theory, empirical evidence, and careful analysis of the laws and institutions that shape mutual funds refute this view.  Fund critics overlook the most salient characteristic of a mutual fund:  redeemable shares.  While boards rarely fire advisors, fund investors may fire advisors at any time by redeeming shares and switching into other investments.  Industry concentration is low, new entry is common, barriers to entry are low, and empirical studies - including new evidence presented in this article - show higher advisory fees significantly reduce fund market shares, and so constrain fees.  Fund performance is consistent with competition exerting a strong disciplinary force on funds and fees. Our findings lead us to reject the critics' views in favor of the legal framework established by Â§36(b) of the Investment Company Act and the lead case interpreting that law (the Gartenberg decision), while suggesting Gartenberg is best interpreted to allow the introduction of evidence regarding competition between funds.

	",22.0,"In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the American intelligence community learned that the al-Qaeda regime has used the Internet in order to covertly plan attacks and communicate with its members, among other things. Indeed, 9/11, as well as every major al-Qaeda terrorist plot since then, involved extensive use of the Internet.  As a result, the government of the United States has entered cyberspace. In particular, the government has developed and utilized several programs that enable it to monitor Internet usage and gather relevant electronic evidence.      
The purpose of this article is to explore whether, and if so to what extent, these surveillance programs have resulted in a chilling effect on the Internet usage of Muslim-Americans. It has been suggested that Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim have modified routine aspects of their daily lives in order to avoid harassment or suspicion. However, the effect of government surveillance measures on this particular area of life, namely the use of Internet technology, has not been formally or scientifically addressed.      
In order to fill this void, a survey of Muslim-Americans was commissioned to determine whether Muslims in the United States have changed their use of the Internet after 9/11 due to a concern that the government may be tracking their online movements. This article presents the results of this survey, which indicate that an overwhelming majority of polled Muslim-Americans believe that their Internet activities are being monitored by the United States government after 9/11, though only a limited segment of the Muslim-American population has made resultant changes in its online behavior.       
In addition to discussing the survey results, this article provides an overview of al-Qaeda's sophisticated use of the Internet and summarizes the government's post-9/11 online surveillance efforts. This article hopes to enrich our current understanding of the potential impact of government measures on Muslims in the United States, and more generally, of the delicate state of pluralism in times of war.

	",117.0,"Complexity theory or, more appropriately, theories, serves as an umbrella term for a number of theories, ideas and research programmes that are derived from scientific disciplines such as meteorology, biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics. Complexity theories are increasingly being seen by academics and practitioners as a way of understanding and changing organizations. The aim of this paper is to review the nature of complexity theories and their importance and implications for organizations and organizational change. It begins by showing how perspectives on organizational change have altered over the last 20 years. This is followed by an examination of complexity theories and their implications for organizational change. The paper concludes by arguing that, even in the natural sciences, the complexity approach is not fully developed or unchallenged, and that, as yet, organization theorists do not appear to have moved beyond the stage of using it as metaphor rather than as a mathematical way of analysing and managing organizations.

	",18.0,"Now that we have lived through one of the most unusual events in American history - the impeachment and trial of the President of the United States - it is appropriate, indeed essential, that we assess how the process worked and learn what we can from it. Specifically, I want to address two questions: First, how well did the impeachment process work? In good academic fashion, I will grade each of the governmental institutions involved - giving them, if you will, a report card. Second, what did we learn from the experience to guide us if, in the future, we face the impeachment of a President?     
Let me start by saying that President Clinton's misbehavior was inexcusable. Had he been more disciplined, the nation would have been spared a year of agony. But his ""inappropriate"" relationship with Monica Lewinsky was neither criminal nor impeachable; and had he been more forthright when confronted in January 1998, we probably also would have been spared the year of torture. However, the $64,000 question is whether his efforts to spare himself, his family, and Monica Lewinsky the embarrassment of disclosure were impeachable offenses.    
Before beginning the evaluation, I would like to disclose my personal connection with the saga. I first became involved when Paula Jones sued the President in 1994. I argued, in an op-ed, that a private damage action against a sitting President must wait until the President is out of office, unless the plaintiff can show irreparable harm from such a delay. After the Supreme Court ultimately rejected that argument, and Independent Counsel Ken Starr sent his referral to the House of Representatives, I urged members of the House not to impeach. I was also one of the law professors who drafted and circulated the letter arguing that the President's actions did not warrant impeachment. Furthermore, I was one of the nineteen constitutional scholars who testified before the House Judiciary Committee on impeachment. After the House voted to impeach the President, I counseled members of the Senate on their role in the President's trial. In short, I am not unbiased but believe I can be fair in evaluating the performance of the various institutions involved, giving a grade to each of them.

Clerks manage their time through diary management (eg. when they have to be in court); clerks negotiate their fees; and clerks counsel them on how their careers should be structured (eg. what kind of law to specialize in, when to become a Queen's Counsel). At one time clerks would receive a percentage of the barrister's fees for this work.    
Nowadays they are mostly salaried. Moreover, the growth of technology has simplified some tasks, such as listing cases in court which can by done through the internet. However, marketing, fixing fees, and counseling careers still endures.    
Using Mary Douglas' idea of taboo, I argue that the clerk defines the dividing line between the sacred area of the law and the profane world of money and clients. The class divisions further emphasize this. Clerks are generally working class compared to the middle-class barrister.    
Both sides are uneasy about the relationship, but as long as the current structure of the Bar exists, the need for this moral division of labor will persist.

First, we show that the forecasting performance of such models compares well with a-theoretical vector autoregressions. Moreover, we illustrate how the posterior distribution of the model can be used to calculate the complete distribution of the forecast, as well as various inflation risk measures that have been proposed in the literature. Finally, the structural nature of the model allows computing forecasts conditional on a policy path. It also allows examining the structural sources of the forecast errors and their implications for monetary policy.

Boston-based Bain & Company recently reported that of the 400 firms it surveyed, nine out of ten had used a mission statement some time in the last five years-thus making it the most popular management tool deployed in recent decades.    
The reason for such popularity is that mission statements s is usually considered the cornerstone of every company's strategy formulation exercise. Most commentaries on mission statemements imply that superior performance results follow shortly after inception. Little evidence exists, however, that proves their true value. Most studies have tended to focus almost exclusively-even obsessively-on their content. None has attempted to compare prescription with practice and only a few have tried to link findings about mission statements to any measures of performance or satisfaction.     
As a result, it is currently unknown how mission statements are actually being used (relative to what the experts are saying), how satisfied companies are with them, or how useful they are to an organization's existence. In other words, do they ""make a differnce"" in terms of performance?

	",356.0,"The most stringent anti-sprawl measure adopted by any American state is Oregon's urban growth boundary (UGB) program. Urban growth boundaries are lines on maps within which high-density development is encouraged, and beyond which such development is generally forbidden. Outside the boundary, rural industries (such as logging) and open space are promoted. This Article focuses on three issues: whether UGBs are constitutional under recent Supreme Court case law, (2) whether the UGB has in fact saved Portland (Oregon's largest city) from the social problems caused by sprawl, and (3) whether the side effects of UGBs make them a cure worse than the disease of sprawl. The article addresses issues (2) and (3) by comparing Portland to three metro areas of comparable size and regional growth rates: Seattle, Denver, and Salt Lake City. The article concludes that: (1) Oregon's UGB presents no constitutional problem, (2) the UGB has promoted infill development within the city of Portland, causing the city to be more prosperous than comparable cities, and (3) that housing prices have not increased more rapidly in Portland than in comparable cities, a fact which suggests that the UGB's effect on housing prices has been minimal. In other ways, Portland has continued to evolve in the same directions as nearby metropolitan areas without UGBs. On the negative side, this means that the UGB has not had an enormous effect upon automobile use, traffic congestion, or urban consumption of farmland. Although Portland's air is cleaner than it was a decade ago, the same is true for other western cities without UGBs. On the positive side, the UGB has not led to the horrors imagined by UGB critics. Portland's real estate is not significantly more expensive than that of comparable western cities, its traffic congestion is no more annoying, and its air is no more polluted. In sum, UGB supporters and opponents alike may have overestimated both the positive and negative effects of UGBs.

	",17.0,"The weather forecast says that there is a ""30% chance of rain,"" and we think we understand what it means. This quantitative statement is assumed to be unambiguous and to convey more information than does a qualitative statement like ""It might rain tomorrow."" Because the forecast is expressed as a single-event probability, however, it does not specify the class of events it refers to. Therefore, even numerical probabilities can be interpreted by members of the public in multiple, mutually contradictory ways. To find out whether the same statement about rain probability evokes various interpretations, we randomly surveyed pedestrians in five metropolises located in countries that have had different degrees of exposure to probabilistic forecasts - Amsterdam, Athens, Berlin, Milan, and New York. They were asked what a ""30% chance of rain tomorrow"" means both in a multiple-choice and a free-response format. Only in New York did a majority of them supply the standard meteorological interpretation, namely, that when the weather conditions are like today, in 3 out of 10 cases there will be (at least a trace of) rain the next day. In each of the European cities, this alternative was judged as the least appropriate. The preferred interpretation in Europe was that it will rain tomorrow ""30% of the time,"" followed by ""in 30% of the area."" To improve risk communication with the public, experts need to specify the reference class, that is, the class of events to which a single-event probability refers.

	",8.0,"This article explores the legal issues hidden within Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha. The geisha tradition has been alternately glorified by Japanese society, and outlawed by Japanese law as a form of prostitution. The leitmotif of Golden's famous novel is this evolving duality of the geisha as both artisan and courtesan. At its worst, the geisha tradition involves force, fraud, and deception, and the horrifying practice of selling one's own children into slavery for purposes of sexual exploitation. In striving for historical accuracy, Golden obtained an intimate interview with a real geisha named Mineko Iwasaki, who consented to reveal to him valuable secrets about the closed geisha society. Using her narrative as source material, Golden wrote a fictional biography of a little girl named Chiyo-chan who is sold by her own father at the age of nine into debt bondage. Like many Japanese girls sold by their parents into forced prostitution and slavery, Chiyo-chan endures a harsh indoctrination and eventually becomes a famous geisha known as Nitta Sayuri. The essence of the novel is the transformation of Chiyo-chan into Nitta Sayuri. The poetic, fairy-tale quality of Golden's prose, and his unusual narrative style, made the novel a literary and financial success upon its publication in 1997. In 2001, however, Mineko Iwasaki shocked the literary world by filing a lawsuit against Golden and his publishers, in New York court under Japanese and New York law, claiming breach of contract, quantum meruit, copyright infringement, unjust enrichment, defamation of character, and violation of her rights to privacy and publicity. It seems that Iwasaki became outraged by the discrepancies between her own life and that of Golden's purportedly fictional geisha. This article asks, and seeks to answer, two questions: First, is the geisha tradition as described by Golden a variant of sex trafficking and sexual slavery which, despite possible cultural justifications, should be abolished by law? Second, does Iwasaki's lawsuit have any merit?

	",15.0,"Paul Mishkin was a colleague and a teacher to us, and we each esteem him as a master craftsman of the law: learned, wise, and far-sighted. To re-read his publications is to enter an astonishing world of clarity and integrity, a world in which no word is wasted and insight is deep and revealing.Early in his career Mishkin saw that the law could be apprehended from two distinct and in part incompatible perspectives: from the internal perspective of a faithful practitioner and from the external perspective of the general public. If the social legitimacy of the law as a public institution resides in the latter, the legal legitimacy of the law as a principled unfolding of professional reason inheres in the former.Mishkin came to believe that although the law required both forms of legitimacy, there was nevertheless serious tension between them, and he dedicated his scholarly career to attempting to theorize this persistent but necessary tension, which he conceived almost as a form of antinomy.In this article we pay tribute to Mishkin's quest for understanding. We argue that the tension identified by Mishkin is significant and unavoidable, but that it is also exaggerated because it presupposes an unduly stringent separation between professional reason and popular values. In our view the law/politics distinction is both real and suffused throughout with ambiguity and uncertainty. The existence of the law/politics distinction creates the possibility of the rule of law, but the ragged and blurred boundaries of that distinction vivify the law by infusing it with the commitments and ideals of those whom the law purports to govern.

	",,"The building blocks of the Sharpe ratio--expected returns and volatilities--are unknown quantities that must be estimated statistically and are, therefore, subject to estimation error. This raises the natural question: How accurately are Sharpe ratios measured? To address this question, I derive explicit expressions for the statistical distribution of the Sharpe ratio using standard asymptotic theory under several sets of assumptions for the return-generating process--independently and identically distributed returns, stationary returns, and with time aggregation. I show that monthly Sharpe ratios cannot be annualized by multiplying by the square root of 12 except under very special circumstances, and I derive the correct method of conversion in the general case of stationary returns. In an illustrative empirical example of mutual funds and hedge funds, I find that the annual Sharpe ratio for a hedge fund can be overstated by as much as 65 percent because of the presence of serial correlation in monthly returns, and once this serial correlation is properly taken into account, the rankings of hedge funds based on Sharpe ratios can change dramatically.

	",,"This article is a comparison of statutory and effective marginal tax rates in Canada. It is similar to a recent study by the Joint Committee on Taxation in the United States, except that both the personal income tax and social security programs are considered. The data source is the Social Policy Simulation Database and Model, which is a Statistics Canada database of tax information on 200,000 individuals.    
Nineteen separate sources of differences between effective and statutory rates are ranked in terms of their impact on effective marginal tax rates in Canada, with the benefit reduction of the guaranteed income supplement for seniors heading the list. It is found that 16.6 million Canadians, or 56 percent of the population, experience some difference between their effective and statutory marginal tax rates. More than one-fifth of the population has at least a 10-percentage-point difference. These Canadian figures are higher than those previously calculated for individual taxpayers in the United States. High effective tax rates are concentrated in the 17-percent federal statutory rate bracket; more taxpayers with effective rates above 45 percent come from this bracket than from the supposedly ""top"" bracket of 31.32 percent. Almost 1 million Canadians, two-thirds of whom are seniors, have an effective marginal tax rate of 60 percent or more.

It tries to raise the plea for the Ecologically sensitive and beneficial wetlands. The setting of the study includes the burgeoning real estate haven of Velachery. These Wetlands are being eaten up by the rampant urban sprawl and unscientific solid waste disposal. The relative callousness coupled with the paradoxical approach of the authorities to development is baffling. Sparring some protests from concerned NGOs and People, there has been very little constructive work for the wetlands and their salvation. The study has used Remote Sensing and Geographic information systems to analyse the extent of damage caused to the ecologically sensitive and essential wetlands. Specie Identification, Water quality analysis and Socio-economic surveys were carried out. It also suggests a Management Plan and hopes that this work would go a long way in the reclamation of this bountiful resource base. The authors of paper hope that this would be a valid step in the path to attain a much-needed salve for the wetlands that can at best remain mute witness to their own doom.

	",25.0,"Bilateral and multilateral investment treaties, such as NAFTA, give foreign investors substantive rights - such as freedom from expropriation - as well as the right to sue host governments for violations of the substantive rights enumerated in the investment treaties.  In the last five years, the number of arbitrations arising under investment treaties has skyrocketed; billions of taxpayer dollars are at stake and government conduct, which would otherwise past domestic muster, is subject to enhanced international scrutiny.  The proliferation of these bilateral and multi-lateral investment treaties has led to an unprecedented increase in the number of arbitration tribunals convened to resolve investor-state disputes.  Arbitral tribunals are now testing and evaluating a variety of international law rights for the first time.  These private tribunals consider legal issues that impact the international economy, public policy and international relations, but they do so in a vacuum largely because of gaps in the academic literature and confidentiality obligations that prevent public decision-making.  Substantive obligations in investment treaties are remarkably similar; notwithstanding these similarities, in the absence of valuable guidance from scholars or appellate bodies, arbitral tribunals have come to inconsistent decisions on the meaning of fundamental international law rights.  This Article recommends a framework for analysis as well as a series of reforms designed to prevent inconsistent decisions from occurring and to correct inconsistencies when they occur.  In terms of preventative measures, the article is a call to arms for academics to contribute to the literature in this emerging discipline to provide authoritative guidance for tribunals to use during the decision making process; it also recommends changes to institutional rules and treaties to enhance transparency and promote public scrutiny.  In terms of corrective measures, this article rejects the treaty-by-treaty approach previously suggested within the literature.  Instead, it proposes the creation of one independent and permanent appellate body with the authority to review awards rendered under the entire investment treaty network.  These measures will promote the integrity and legitimacy of a private dispute resolution system with wide-ranging public implications.

Barriers to Entry: A Market Lock-In Model of Discrimination,76 Pages,Posted: 18 Jan 2001,Daria RoithmayrGregory B. FairchildDaria RoithmayrGregory B. FairchildKirsten E. MartinR. Edward FreemanJared D. HarrisHarry J. Sapienza,"

	",19.0,"This article draws on recent literature in economics on increasing returns, network effects and market lock-in, to advance two types of arguments - one descriptive and one normative - about racism in the context of law school admissions.  First, I suggest that it might be useful to view white dominance in law school admissions as the product of a locked-in, culturally and racially specific network standard that favors white applicants. Anticompetitive conduct by white professional leaders and law school administrators during the Jim Crow era created an overwhelming initial advantage, if not an outright monopoly, in early market competition for law student admissions.  This monopoly, which lasted well over a century, may have produced a de facto standard that favors white cultural performances and disproportionately excludes people of color in admissions.  Over time, reinforcing institutional networks have grown up around this culturally specific standard, and have effectively locked the standard into market structures.    
For example, to gain access to the legal profession network, law schools have had to adopt admissions criteria that rely on the Law School Admissions Test (""LSAT""), which at least in its earlier incarnations was designed to exclude applicants of color.  Law schools wishing to maintain their national ranking or place graduates in lucrative positions must admit students based on their scores, because legal professionals and law school rankings recognize high LSAT scores for the entering class as a signal of the school's ""quality.""  In turn, those schools wishing to attract applicants with high LSAT scores must maintain their national rankings and post-graduation employment rates.  Thus, over time, the LSAT standard has become progressively more embedded into the network, creating significant barriers to entry for people of color whose cultural performances do not conform to the standard.    
Second, a lock-in model of discrimination may have several more normative implications. Initially, (and most controversially), it suggests that current admissions standards are not solely the race-neutral, efficient products of market competition, but rather are the self-reinforcing product of earlier anticompetitive conduct by whites.  Because such anticompetitive behavior will not necessarily produce the most efficient market outcomes, there is no guarantee that law school admissions criteria produce applicants who are the best legal problem-solvers or even the best law students.  In addition, the model suggests that racial disparities persist because communities of color do not enjoy true equal opportunity to compete.  At the turn of the century, whites intentionally excluded people of color from participating in the establishment of the defacto standard in law school admissions and the legal profession.  Currently, a locked-in market standard creates significant barriers to entry for people of color.  Far from a level playing field, competition takes place in markets where white monopoly power may have become self-reinforcing.  Finally, the model proposes a politically useful metaphor or analogy for discrimination and affirmative action. A market lock-in analogy frames racism in antitrust terms, as historically anticompetitive conduct that over time will continue to exclude people of color, even in the absence of continuing intentional discrimination. Likewise, the model redescribes affirmative action as a type of antitrust remedy, designed to dismantle a locked-in white monopoly on opportunity and resources.

Over the period as a whole, we find some evidence of a modest against the wind effect, but interventions do not have value as a forecast that the exchange rate will move in a direction consistent with the operations.  Interventions conducted between 1995 and 2002, which were large and infrequent, met with a much higher degree of success.  For the most recent episode of intervention, in 2003 and 2004, despite the record size and frequency of the overall episode, it is difficult to statistically distinguish the pattern of exchange rate movements on intervention days from that of all the days in that particular subperiod, showing little effectiveness.  Still, while the evidence of Japanese intervention effectiveness is modest overall, it appears to be stronger than that found using similar techniques for U.S. intervention operations conducted in the 1980s and 1990s.

	",53.0,"Current domestic and international law relating to immigration tends to favor law enforcement over human rights approaches. Despite these tendencies, international law has helped develop a human rights framework applicable to migrants. In particular, this paper hypothesizes that international human rights treaties that deal specifically with migrants' rights may provide some small but meaningful gains for migrants by: (1) influencing non-binding regional processes; (2) contributing to the development and dissemination of best practices; and (3) producing and codifying a human rights discourse. If such an account is correct, the emphasis on whether states formally adopt international law obscures some of the less obvious benefits of developing immigration human rights treaties and their related regimes.   	  First, the article suggests that treaties can be agenda-setting for non-binding regional processes. While political science scholars have begun looking at the effects of such processes more generally, few international law scholars address this phenomenon. This paper hopes to spur some interdisciplinary discourse by suggesting that non-binding regional processes create a pathway by which international law may reach and influence even those states skeptical about joining international treaty regimes. Second, the article investigates the way in which immigration human rights treaties may contribute to the development and dissemination of best practices. Third, this paper conjectures that treaties assist in the production and codification of a human rights discourse. It relies on insights from psychology to demonstrate why language and rhetoric might guide state and individual behavior.     
Finally, this paper concludes with a snapshot of Italian immigration policy as a case study. Italy provides a discrete example of how international treaties can influence domestic legislation as well as highlights some of the difficulties in promoting and enforcing migrants' human rights.

	",12.0,"Economists and policymakers have recently defended the extension of copyright protection to assure the efficient exploitation of existing works.  They assert that works in the public domain may be under-exploited due to the lack of property rights or over-exploited due to congestion externalities.  This study compares the availability, number of editions, and prices of 166 public domain bestsellers published from 1913-1922 with 168 copyrighted bestsellers from 1923-1932.  It also compares the 20 most durable public domain works from 1913-1922 with the 20 most durable protected works from 1923-1932.  A significantly higher percentage of the public domain books are still in print, with significantly more editions available per book, and for the sub-set of especially durable works, the public domain works are significantly less expensive.  Although the data show that rates of availability for both kinds of books are likely sensitive to reductions in the cost of duplication and distribution, the study concludes that protection of fiction beyond the period necessary to ensure its creation is not justified by concerns about under-exploitation.

	",35.0,"The hedge fund industry is starting to recognize that a main part of its returns corresponds to risk premia rather than market inefficiencies, i.e., from beta instead of alpha. This has some implication for the industry and investors, among which is the endeavor to construct investable benchmarks for hedge funds on the basis of an analysis of the underlying systematic risk factors and a subsequent replication of the corresponding risk premia with generic trading systems. The question touches further rationale on the sense and nonsense of the currently available investable versions of hedge fund indices. If possible, investable benchmarks based on risk factor analysis and replication offers a valid, theoretically more sound, and cheaper alternative to the currently offered hedge fund index products, especially as the latter reveal themselves more and more as questionable from a theoretical as well as practical standpoint.  This article reflects on this most recent discussion within the global hedge fund industry about the beta versus alpha controversy, investable hedge fund indices, and finally, capacity issues. It illustrates how the current research activities in the quant groups of the large investment banks and financial academic centers might turn the hedge fund industry upside down in coming years.

	",25.0,"Of the 27 major armed conflicts that occurred in 1999, all but two took place within national boundaries. As an impediment to development, internal rebellion especially hurts the world's poorest countries. What motivates civil wars? Greed or grievance?    
Collier and Hoeffler compare two contrasting motivations for rebellion: greed and grievance. Most rebellions are ostensibly in pursuit of a cause, supported by a narrative of grievance. But since grievance assuagement through rebellion is a public good that a government will not supply, economists predict such rebellions would be rare. Empirically, many rebellions appear to be linked to the capture of resources (such as diamonds in Angola and Sierra Leone, drugs in Colombia, and timber in Cambodia). Collier and Hoeffler set up a simple rational choice model of greed-rebellion and contrast its predictions with those of a simple grievance model.    
Some countries return to conflict repeatedly. Are they conflict-prone or is there a feedback effect whereby conflict generates grievance, which in turn generates further conflict? The authors show why such a feedback effect might be present in both greed-motivated and grievance rebellions. The authors' results contrast with conventional beliefs about the causes of conflict. A stylized version of conventional beliefs would be that grievance begets conflict, which begets grievance, which begets further conflict. With such a model, the only point at which to intervene is to reduce the level of objective grievance.    
Collier and Hoeffler's model suggests that what actually happens is that opportunities for predation (controlling primary commodity exports) cause conflict and the grievances this generates induce dias-poras to finance further conflict. The point of policy intervention here is to reduce the absolute and relative attraction of primary commodity predation and to reduce the ability of diasporas to fund rebel movements.

	",11.0,"Contract law encourages parties to make relation-specific investments by enforcing the contracts the parties make, and by denying liability when the parties had failed to agree. For decades, the law has had difficulty with cases where parties sink costs in the pursuit of projects under agreements that are too incomplete to enforce, and where one of the parties prefers to exit rather than pursue the contemplated project. The issue whether to award the disappointed party  any remedy has divided a large number of courts over many years. The judicial uncertainty arises, we claim, because the questions why parties make such incomplete contracts, then rely before uncertainty is resolved and finally disagree over cost reimbursement when both recognize that their project would be unprofitable have not been satisfactorily answered. We create a model which shows that parties create ""preliminary agreements"" rather than complete contracts when the project they explore could take a number of forms, and the parties are unsure at the outset which form would maximize profits. A preliminary agreement roughly allocates investment tasks between the parties, specifies investment timing and commits the parties only to pursue a profitable project. Parties sink costs in a project because investment accelerates the realization of returns and illuminates whether any of the possible project types would be profitable. A party to a preliminary agreement ""breaches"" when it delays its investment beyond the time the agreement specifies. Delay will save costs for this party if no project turns out to be profitable and improves this party's bargaining power in the renegotiation to a complete contract if a project would succeed. Delay often disadvantages the promisee, but the main inefficiency is ex ante: When parties anticipate such strategic behavior, the likelihood that they will make preliminary agreements is materially reduced. This is unfortunate because the performance of a preliminary agreement often is a necessary condition to the creation of a complete contract and the subsequent realization of a socially efficient opportunity. Thus, contract law should encourage relation-specific investment by awarding verifiable reliance costs to a party to a preliminary agreement if its partner has strategically delayed investment. We also study a large sample of appellate cases that deal with reliance prior to the signing of a complete contract. This study reveals that (a) parties appear to make the preliminary agreements we describe and breach for the reasons our model identifies; and (b) courts sometimes protect the disappointed party's reliance interest when they should, but the courts' imperfect understanding of the parties' behavior causes courts to make mistakes.

The gap in the chosen level of performance (output per capita) is very large, about 30%, and the remedy is clear: cut taxes in Europe. But Europe is different from America: for deep historical, cultural reasons, but partly because the pressures to consume are different.

However, the final version of the rule adopted by the SEC defined experts to include both accounting and non-accounting experts. Did the SEC do the right thing? Are the non-accounting experts just as competent as the accounting experts in enhancing the quality of financial reporting? For a sample of S&P 500 firms we examine whether the audit committee's financial expertise is associated with accounting conservatism, a fundamental characteristic of financial reporting. Our results suggest that an audit committee's financial expertise is positively associated with conservatism when financial expertise is defined to include only accounting experts. Our findings are consistent with the notion that accounting expertise contributes to greater monitoring by the members of the audit committee which in turn enhances conservatism.  However, this finding is conditional upon the firm's overall corporate governance, i.e., in weak boards accounting financial expertise is ineffective in promoting conservative accounting.  Our findings have implications for regulators, corporate boards, and the accounting profession. Our findings are also relevant to regulators in other countries who are considering adopting measures to enhance corporate governance, particularly the effectiveness of the audit committees.

	",,"The new NYSE rules for corporate governance require the audit committee to discuss and review the firm's risk assessment and hedging strategies. They also put additional requirements for the composition and the financial knowledge of the directors sitting on the board and on the audit committee. In this paper, we investigate whether these new rules as well as those set by the Sarbanes Oxley act lead to hedging decisions that are of more benefit to shareholders. We construct a novel hand collected dataset that allows us to explore multiple definitions for the financially knowledgeable term present in this new regulation.    
We find that the requirements on the audit committee size and independence are beneficial to shareholders, although maintaining a majority of unrelated directors in the board and a director with an accounting background on the audit committee may not be necessary. Interestingly, financially educated directors seem to encourage corporate hedging while financially active directors and those with an accounting background play no active role in such policy. This evidence combined with the positive relation we report between hedging and the firm's performance suggests that shareholders are better off with financially educated directors on their boards and audit committees. Our empirical findings also show that having directors with a university education on the board is an important determinant of the hedging level. Indeed, our measure of risk management is found to be an increasing function of the percentage of directors holding a diploma superior to a bachelor degree. This result is the first direct evidence concerning the importance of university education for the board of directors.

	",,"What should lawyers think about and respond to death-row volunteers?  When a defendant accused of a capital crime attempts to plead guilty, or instructs his lawyer not to present a particular defense;  when a convicted killer refuses to permit the introduction of potentially life-saving mitigating evidence - or even urges the jury to impose a death sentence - at the sentencing phase of a death-eligible case; when a condemned inmate refuses to file, or to appeal the denial of, habeas corpus and other post-conviction petitions for relief; when he elects not to object to a particular capital-punishment method, to call into question his own competence to be executed, or to file an eleventh-hour, last-ditch appeal citing newly discovered evidence of his innocence -what should lawyers do?    
These are not questions of merely professional interest, narrowly conceived, for lawyers and judges.  That said, the death-row volunteer is of particular interest to lawyers because he poses particularly chilling problems for lawyers.  It is suggested in this paper that something is missing from our thinking and conversations about the death-row-volunteer problem:  Our arguments - which sound primarily in the register of choice, competence, and autonomy - reflect and proceed from an unsound moral anthropology.  That is, they proceed from a flawed account of what it is about the human person that does the work in moral arguments about what we ought or ought not to do and about how we ought or ought not to be treated.   The unfortunate result is that the professed commitment to human dignity  that drives and sustains so many capital-defense lawyers  is often undermined by these same lawyers' responses to death-row volunteers.

	",58.0,"Mergers and acquisitions are extremely sensitive, both within and outside the organizations involved. Confidentiality agreements are therefore essential for allowing teams the 'space' to develop potential scenarios for future integration. Despite the importance of confidentiality in practice, the subject has received little coverage in the management literature. By adopting a case-study approach, this research explores aspects of confidentiality in a four-year post-acquisition integration programme in a FTSE100 pharmaceutical company. The paper identifies a range of personal impacts on the signatories, as well as various dimensions of information transfer despite the agreement being in place. Through the use of a metaphor, the research suggests that a confidentiality agreement has many similarities with the properties and characteristics of a bubble. This bubble trope is used to enhance conceptual understanding of confidentiality constraints in an organizational-change context. The paper concludes by suggesting some 'key learnings' in relation to using confidentiality agreements in strategic change programmes such as a merger or acquisition.

	",16.0,"The orthodox justification for intellectual property is utilitarian. Advocates for strong IP rights argue that absent such rights copyists will free-ride on the efforts of creators and stifle innovation. This orthodox justification is logically straightforward and well reflected in the law. Yet a significant empirical anomaly exists: the global fashion industry, which produces a huge variety of creative goods without strong IP protection. Copying is rampant as the orthodox account would predict. Yet innovation and investment remain vibrant. Few commentators have considered the status of fashion design in IP law. Those who have almost uniformly criticize the current legal regime for failing to protect apparel designs. But the fashion industry itself is surprisingly quiescent about copying. Firms take steps to protect the value of trademarks, but appear to accept appropriation of designs as a fact of life. This diffidence about copying stands in striking contrast to the heated condemnation of piracy and associated legislative and litigation campaigns in other creative industries.   
Why, when other major content industries have obtained increasingly powerful IP protections for their products, does fashion design remain mostly unprotected - and economically successful? The fashion industry is a puzzle for the orthodox justification for IP rights. This paper explores this puzzle. We argue that the fashion industry counter-intuitively operates within a low-IP equilibrium in which copying does not deter innovation and may actually promote it. We call this the piracy paradox. This paper offers a model explaining how the fashion industry's piracy paradox works, and how copying functions as an important element of and perhaps even a necessary predicate to the industry's swift cycle of innovation. In so doing, we aim to shed light on the creative dynamics of the apparel industry. But we also hope to spark further exploration of a fundamental question of IP policy: to what degree are IP rights necessary to induce innovation? Are stable low-IP equilibria imaginable in other industries as well? Part I describes the fashion industry and its dynamics and illustrates the prevalence of copying in the industry. Part II advances an explanation for the piracy paradox that rests on two features: induced obsolescence and anchoring. Both phenomena reflect the status-conferring power of fashion, and both suggest that copying, rather than impeding innovation and investment, promotes them. Part II also considers, and rejects, alternative explanations of the endurance of the low-IP status quo. Part III considers extensions of our arguments to other fields. By examining copyright's negative space - those creative endeavors that copyright does not address - we argue can we can better understand the relationship between copyright and innovation.

	",17.0,"The Constitution of the United States provides, in Article V, for its own amendment; but not every proposal for change is properly ""an Amendment[] to this Constitution"" within the meaning of Article V. Rather, there are substantive limitations on what can be accomplished as a constitutional amendment. The term amendment refers not to making any kind of change to the existing document, but to fine-tuning what is already in place. As the debates over the adoption of the Bill of Rights make clear, an amendment is not the pursuit of something new, but an intervention, shown by experience to be necessary in order to keep the Constitution on its original course. Some proposals for change so undermine the original document that they cannot be considered amendments and therefore cannot be achieved through the procedures of Article V. Any proposal to alter the Constitution through Article V requires evaluating not only the merits of the proposal, but also whether it is a proper use of the amendment process.    
To say that the amendment provision of Article V is limited is not to conclude that the Constitution contains entrenched provisions that can never be changed and that it is therefore undemocratic. Americans may alter each and every provision of their Constitution, but they cannot always do so through Article V. Modifications that are more than mere amendments to the existing Constitution require higher lawmaking: the articulation of new principles by the citizenry in a period of constitutional politics, the kind that occur following a revolution or some other seismic event that alters our course going forward. One such seismic event was, of course, the Civil War, which did revisit and change the document that was ratified in 1788. The Reconstruction Amendments revised the 1788 Constitution in fundamental respects, putting in place a new and very different regime. Significantly, these changes were not achieved through the amendment procedures of Article V, and they far exceeded what could have been done through those procedures. Accordingly, the Civil War altered Article V itself, putting in place new limitations on the kinds of changes that could subsequently be accomplished as constitutional amendments. One particular transition stands out. Under the 1788 Constitution, no modification that undermined the autonomy of the states with respect to slavery could be accommodated as a constitutional amendment. Yet once Article V was reconstructed, no constitutional amendment could permit states to create within their borders sub-classes of people like slaves. This Article explores these changes and considers some recent proposed amendments in light of the Reconstruction limits.    
The primary purposes of this Article are to restore the early understanding of Article V and to reject the view expressed by modern commentators that the Constitution should be kept largely immune from amendment. A constitutional amendment is a significant event that is not easily achieved, but it is less momentous than a fundamental change to the system of government that results from a revolution or civil war. Amending the Constitution is more serious and difficult than ordinary legislation, but it is much less so than a transformative act by We the People. Article V allows for - indeed invites - citizens to examine in an ongoing fashion the details of their constitutional arrangements and to correct those things that do not serve well the basic design. Rather than keep Article V locked away, beyond the reach of citizens, it is more faithful to the Constitution's design and to the project of self-government to make available the amendment procedure for its deliberately limited uses.

	",,"Since WWII it has been the stated policy of the U.S. government to simultaneously pursue high employment and stable prices. Paradoxically, neither accepted economic theory nor practical experience appears to indicate that high or full employment is even possible with stable prices. In this paper we argue that stable prices and truly full employment are indeed possible. In fact, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act sets the goalpost too low; we argue that the government can guarantee a zero unemployment rate, defined as all who are ready, willing, and able to work at the going wage will be able to find a job--only those unwilling (or unable) to work at the going wage would be left without work (which are not normally counted as unemployed). The government does this by acting as the employer of last resort, offering to hire all who show up to work at a fixed wage. In doing so, the government ensures that all who are ready, willing, and able to work at that wage will be provided a job. At the same time, by setting this wage, the government will provide a price anchor that will impart price stability to the system, that is, we will show that a true full employment policy is not, in itself, ""inflationary"" and indeed could reduce inflationary pressures under some conditions. Further, the full employment policy would help to reduce economic fluctuations (the ""business cycle"") through a powerful built-in automatic stabilizer feature.

	",65.0,"Developments in the financial sector have led to an expansion in its ability to spread risks. The increase in the risk bearing capacity of economies, as well as in actual risk taking, has led to a range of financial transactions that hitherto were not possible, and has created much greater access to finance for firms and households. On net, this has made the world much better off. Concurrently, however, we have also seen the emergence of a whole range of intermediaries, whose size and appetite for risk may expand over the cycle. Not only can these intermediaries accentuate real fluctuations, they can also leave themselves exposed to certain small probability risks that their own collective behaviour makes more likely. As a result, under some conditions, economies may be more exposed to financial-sector-induced turmoil than in the past. The paper discusses the implications for monetary policy and prudential supervision. In particular, it suggests market-friendly policies that would reduce the incentive of intermediary managers to take excessive risk.

The IMF reform programme for the crisis-affected Asian countries suggested they should abandon the Asian business model and adopt the US corporate model. The main findings are: (a) contrary to GSI doctrine, poor corporate governance and lack of competition are not common characteristics of the Asian business model; (b) the stock market-based US business model has severe limitations for developing country corporations, not least because of imperfect share prices and the imperfect market for corporate control.

SMH and its main brand, Swatch, was the outcome of crisis for the Swiss watch industry. In a few short decades, foreign competitors with superior technology had all but eliminated the Swiss from a global industry that they dominated for centuries. The creation of Swatch is the extraordinary story of how the Swiss re-invented their watch industry. Recognizing the crucial role of brand intangibles to its future success, SMH changed its name to the Swatch Group in 1998. Now in the new millennium the Group needs to chart a strategy to preserve and enhance its stable of global brands.

	",23.0,"It is well known that there is a strong positive correlation between per capita incomes and the quality of governance across countries. Kaufmann and Kraay propose an empirical strategy that allows separation of this correlation into (1) a strong positive causal effect running from better governance to higher per capita incomes, and, perhaps surprisingly at first, (2) a weak and even negative causal effect running in the opposite direction from per capita incomes to governance.    
The first result confirms existing evidence on the importance of good governance for economic development. The second result is new and suggests the absence of a ""virtuous circle"" in which higher incomes lead to further improvements in governance. This motivates the authors' choice of title, ""Growth Without Governance."" They document this evidence using a newly updated set of worldwide governance-indicators covering 175 countries for the period 2000-01, and use the results to interpret the relationship between incomes and governance focusing on the Latin America and Caribbean regionÂ—within a worldwide empirical context. Finally, the authors speculate about the potential importance of elite influence and state capture in accounting for the surprising negative effects of per capita incomes on governance, present some evidence on such capture in some Latin American countries, and suggest priorities for actions to improve governance when such pernicious elite influence shapes public policy.    
This paper - a joint product of the World Bank Institute and the Development Research Group - is part of a larger effort in the Bank to generate and analyze worldwide governance indicators, assessing the manifestations and consequences of governance.

	",,"In the wake of the 2000 presidential election, there will be debate about whether a nationwide popular vote should be substituted for the electoral college mechanism for choosing the President. That debate may be stifled because of the widespread assumption that constitutional amendment is the only way to  effect this change. But, in fact, a constitutional amendment may not be necessary.     
State legislatures have ""plenary"" power in establishing the manner of appointment of electors. There would seem to be no obstacle to a state legislature's providing beforehand that its electoral college delegation would be that pledged to the winner of the nationwide popular vote. If states with just 270 electoral votes adopted such an approach, the popular vote winner would perforce win the presidency. At the present time, a mere eleven states control 270 electoral votes.     
Even fewer might suffice. Adoption by the swing state of Wisconsin with eleven electoral votes, or by Missouri and Minnesota with a total of 21 across the political divide, would tilt the system decidedly toward popular election. Deprived of the ability single mindedly to pursue an electoral college strategy, candidates would be even less likely than they have been historically to secure an electoral college win without winning the popular vote.     
The politics are tricky, but if some states took the lead, others might follow and opposition to an amendment might melt away. The article draws on the history of the Seventeenth Amendment to assess the possibilities.

We extend prior research in two important directions.  First, using a pooled sample of 2,295 firms for the fiscal year 2000, we find very little evidence of a relation between the provision of non-audit services and measure of accruals.  However, there appears to be three distinct clusters of firms where only one cluster (consisting of only about 20 percent of the sample) exhibits a statistically positive association between non-audit fees and accrual behavior.  Second, we examine the corporate governance characteristics of firms in the cluster with a positive association between non-audit fees and accrual behavior relative to the remaining firms.  We find that this subset of firms have a smaller market capitalization, lower institutional holdings, higher insider holdings, smaller board of directors (and audit committee), and lower percentage of independent board (and audit committee) members.  These results suggest that the provision of non-audit services is potentially problematic only for a small subset of firms that appear to be de facto controlled by management.

	",51.0,"The community of corporate law scholars in the United States is fragmented. One group, heavily influenced by economic analysis of corporations, is exploring the merits of increasing shareholder power vis-a-vis directors. Another group, animated by concern for social justice, is challenging the traditional, shareholder-centric view of corporate law, arguing instead for a model of stakeholder governance. The current disagreement within corporate law is as fundamental as in any area of law, and the debate is more heated than at any time since the New Deal.    
This paper is part of a debate on the audacious question, Can Corporate Law Save the World? In the first part of the debate, Professor Kent Greenfield builds on his book, THE FAILURE OF CORPORATE LAW: FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS AND PROGRESSIVE POSSIBILITIES, offering a provocative critique of the status quo and arguing that corporate law matters to issues like the environment, human rights, and the labor question.    
In response, Professor Smith contends that corporate law does not matter in the way Professor Greenfield claims. Corporate law is the set of rules that defines the decision making structure of corporations, and reformers like Professor Greenfield have only two options for changing corporate decision making: changing the decision maker or changing the decision rule. More specifically, he focuses on board composition and shareholder primacy. Professor Smith argues that changes in corporate law cannot eradicate poverty or materially change existing distributions of wealth, except by impairing the creation of wealth. Changes in corporate law will not clean the environment. And changes in corporate law will not solve the labor question. Indeed, the only changes in corporate law that will have a substantial effect on such issues are changes that make the world worse, not better.

	",79.0,"The co-existing land interests of Aborigines and colonisers on northern Australian cattle stations had feudal qualities that helped sustain the cattle industry for over a century. The feudal form of labour relations made otherwise incompatible land claims compatible, and thus functioned to buttress pastoralists' power and to allow Aboriginal people to maintain connection with their land. It also meant that Aboriginal workers could be exploited on large scale. To gain the labour force they needed, the pastoralists did not allow Aboriginal workers freedom of mobility, but neither did they require the force of slavery. Thus, the freedom/slavery dichotomy that traditionally frames scholarly debate does not apply to labour relations on northern cattle stations. Only since the Equal Wage decision of 1966 has the significance of these feudal land relations been realised: although arising from pastoralists' exploitation, these relations raise possibilities for Indigenous title in Australian property law, which continues to privilege European claims.

	",2.0,"This essay shows how existing rules of criminal procedure are poorly equipped to regulate the collection of digital evidence. It predicts that new rules of criminal procedure will evolve to regulate digital evidence investigations, and offers preliminary thoughts on what those rules should look like and what institutions should generate them.     
Digital evidence will trigger new rules of criminal procedure because computer-related crimes feature new facts that will demand new law. The law of criminal procedure has evolved to regulate the mechanisms common to the investigation of physical crime, namely the collection of physical evidence and eyewitness testimony. Existing law is naturally tailored to the law enforcement needs and privacy threats they raise. Computers have recently introduced a new form of evidence: digital evidence, consisting of zeros and ones of electricity. Digital evidence is collected in different ways than eyewitness testimony or physical evidence. The new ways of collecting evidence are so different that the rules developed for the old investigations often no longer make sense for the new. Rules that balance privacy and public safety when applied to the facts of physical crime investigations often lead to astonishing results when applied to the facts of computer crime investigations. They permit extraordinarily invasive government powers to go unregulated in some contexts, and yet allow phantom privacy threats to shut down legitimate investigations in others.  
This Essay explores the dynamics of computer crime investigations and the new methods of collecting electronic evidence. It contends that the new dynamics demonstrate the need for procedural doctrines designed specifically to regulate digital evidence collection. The rules should impose some new restrictions on police conduct and repeal other limits with an eye to the new social and technological practices that are common to how we use and misuse computers. Further, the Essay suggests that we should look beyond the judiciary and the Fourth Amendment for the source of these new rules. While some changes can and likely will come from the courts, many more can come from legislatures and executive agencies that can offer new and creative approaches not tied directly to our constitutional traditions.    
Indeed, a number of new rules are beginning to emerge from Congress and the Courts already. In the last five years, a number of courts have started to interpret the Fourth Amendment differently in computer crime cases. They have quietly rejected traditional rules and created new ones to respond to new facts of how computers operate. At a legislative level, Congress has enacted computer-specific statutes to address other new threats to privacy. The changes are modest ones so far. Taken together, however, the new constitutional and statutory rules may be seen as the beginning of a new subfield of criminal procedure that regulates the collection of digital evidence.  
This Essay will proceed in three parts. Part One compares the basic mechanisms of traditional crimes and computer-related crimes. It explains how the switch from physical to electronic crimes brings a switch from physical evidence and eyewitness testimony to digital evidence, and how investigators tends to use very different methods of collecting the two types of evidence. Part Two turns from the facts to the governing law, focusing on the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. It shows that existing Fourth Amendment doctrine is naturally tailored to the facts of physical crimes, but that a number of difficulties arise when that doctrine is applied to the facts of computer crime investigations. Part Three argues that new rules are needed to govern digital evidence collection, and offers preliminary thoughts on what those rules might look like and what institutions should generate them. It also shows that courts and Congress already have begun responding to the problem of digital evidence with a number of computer-specific rules.

Over 1991-2004 equity fund investor timing decisions reduce fund investor average returns by 1.56% annually. Underperformance due to poor timing is greater in load funds and funds with relatively large risk-adjusted returns. In particular, the magnitude of investor underperformance due to poor timing largely offsets the risk-adjusted alpha gains offered by good-performing funds. Investors in both actively managed funds and index funds exhibit poor investment timing. We demonstrate that our empirical results are consistent with investor return-chasing behavior.

	",,"The future of the free dissemination of information lies in the blog, some may say. The internet has entirely transformed how we receive and consume information. It's the newest incarnation of information dissemination. From the insights of Alexis de Tocqueville, ""Feelings and opinions are recruited, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed only by the reciprocal influence of [individuals] upon one another."" Bloggers are a powerful force in the distribution of information and ideas and the creation of communities of conversation.  
Throughout history, the dissemination of information, news, opinions, and ideas has continuously transformed. In the 18th Century, there was the town crier, the pamphleteer, hand-billing, leafleting and the emergence of the newspaper. Later, radio and then television emerged in the 20th Century. There has been a constant advancement in the dissemination of information, and the internet is the latest medium.  
The blog is essentially today's version of the pamphleteer. Spontaneous order is at play in this modern marketplace of ideas. The blogosphere is truly a transformation and a popular revolution in the provision of information. This Article presents an historical perspective on information flow and the marketplace for ideas, and argues that the blogosphere is merely a technological transformation and stimulus of traditional pamphleteering - an individual's opportunity to introduce his ideas to the community.

	",12.0,"Freeze-out transactions, in which a controlling shareholder buys out the minority shareholders, have occurred more frequently since the stock market downturn of 2000 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While freeze-outs were historically executed as statutory mergers, recent Delaware case law facilitates a new mechanism - freeze-out via tender offer - by eliminating entire fairness review for these transactions. This Article identifies two social welfare costs of the current doctrinal regime. First, the freeze-out tender offer mechanism facilitates some inefficient (value-destroying) transactions by allowing the controller to exploit asymmetric information against the minority. Second, the freeze-out merger mechanism may deter some efficient (value-increasing) transactions because of the special committee's ability to block the deal. These negative wealth effects are unlikely to be resolved through private contracting between the controller and the minority. Rather than advocating patchwork reforms to correct these problems, this Article proposes a return to first principles of corporate law in the freeze-out context. The result of this re-grounding would be convergence in judicial standards of review for freeze-outs, and elimination of the efficiency loss that is inherent in existing doctrine. A companion paper, Post-Siliconix Freeze-outs: Theory & Evidence, provides empirical evidence on freeze-outs.

We investigate the consequences of the introduction of such a tax on an asset market model from a game-theoretic and an experimental point of view. Our main results include in respect to our model that contrary to the situation in game-theoretic equilibrium, the Tobin tax  i) reduces trade volume, ii) reduces volatility, iii) increases market efficiency, and iv) decreases earnings inequality.

This paper addresses these two interlinked questions. A safe haven is defined as a security that is uncorrelated with stocks and bonds in case of a market crash. This is counterpoised against a hedge, defined as a security that is uncorrelated with stocks or bonds on average. We study constant and time-varying relationships between stocks, bonds and gold in order to investigate the existence of a hedge and a safe haven. The empirical analysis examines US, UK and German stock and bond returns and their relationship with gold returns. We find that gold is a hedge against stocks on average and a safe haven in extreme stock market conditions. This finding suggests that the existence of a safe haven enhances the stability and resiliency of financial markets since it reduces investors' losses at times when a reduction is needed the most. A portfolio analysis further shows that the safe haven property is extremely short-lived so that an investor buying gold one day after a shock loses money.

	",58.0,"The idea of an ""ownership society"" (OS) is not new to American politics or law.  It might be called the seventeen year cicada of American domestic policy - emerging once per generation onto the national agenda, generating just a bit of buzz, then receding once again to leave a mass of empty shells and buried eggs behind.  Unlike the insects, however, OS proposals seldom have sounded the same notes to everyone's ears.  They have been proffered to or on behalf of differing constituencies for differing reasons, and therefore have tended to mean different things to different people.  It is tempting to blame precisely this fragmentation and polyvalence both for the general idea's recurrence and for its repeated receding.  
This Article seeks to bring theoretic and programmatic coherence to the idea of an American OS, in hopes of generating an enduring and endurable version of it.  The Article first identifies three political traditions that amount to our self-understandings as a people.  An enduring American OS must resonate with those traditions.  The Article then synthesizes a unified self-understanding from the three traditions - a coherent set of constitutive ideals that contour what the Article calls an Efficient Equal-Opportunity Republic (EEOR).  The EEOR is the template for an endurable American OS.  The Article then fleshes out the bare bones of the EEOR.  It does so first by detailing how ""ownership"" must be interpreted and promoted not only in keeping with the broad constraints posed by the EEOR's core values, but in keeping with the narrower constraints posed by ownership psychology and the path-dependence of American law.  It does so second by deriving a ""Method"" of financially engineered ownership-spreading that gives full expression both to the aforementioned core values and to the psychological and legal constraints.  
The Article concludes with a preview of its sequel, which catalogues and critically examines past OS programs and proposals under the aspect of the theory worked out in the present Article, and elaborates a coherent set of forward-looking ownership-promoting programs informed by the lessons that emerge from that critical encounter.

The recent announcement by the Attorney-General of New Zealand of a five-judge Supreme Court to replace the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  represents the penultimate stage in removing the right of appeals to the Privy Council. This has been all but inevitable since the release by the Attorney-General of a discussion paper proposing the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council. This was motivated by a political desire to end appeals to a London-based tribunal.  While Miss Wilson might like to have all-party political support for her measure, she did not receive whole-hearted support from the legal community  - or from much of the business sector.  Before abolition of the right of appeal to the Privy Council, the Government and the legal profession needed to be agreed about a court structure and exactly how it would work. Although Miss Wilson has stated that the legal profession has itself accepted the need for ending appeals, it is unlikely that this represents the real attitude of the legal profession, or the business community.

	",52.0,"This article observes the legalized character of the phenomenon popularly called ""globalization."" We examine what it means to be a legalized phenomenon, and observe that an important part of legalization is legitimation. In domestic legal regimes, legitimation is accomplished through the Rule of Law which makes certain claims about the nature of the society of which the legal regime is a part. In the international trading system of which globalization is the legalized regime, the legitimizing role is played by Ricardo's so-called Law of comparative advantage. This globalized legitimation, similar to domestic legitimation, makes certain claims about the nature of the system of which it is a part. We examine what features of globalization are supported by the Law of comparative advantage, and note how the legitimating role of that Law conceals the true nature of those features.  We note that comparative advantage requires that both capital and labor be immobile and that, absent that dual mobility, WTO reliance upon the Law of comparative advantage seems foolish. We also note that comparative advantage requires that technology be freely transportable and that attempts such as TRIPS (paradoxically premised upon comparative advantage) to internationalize intellectual property and erect barriers to its free transport violate this fundamental principle in a similarly foolish manner. Unsurprisingly, the features we examine, contrary to their express claims, produce disastrous global resource disparities. We conclude that it is the legitimizing functions of the Law of comparative advantage that allows globalization to proceed in this manner while claiming to do the opposite. The legitimizing function of the global regime thus prevents a true understanding of globalization's nature.  	  The Law of comparative advantage, in its rule-based legalism, condemns opponents, almost by definition, as lawless anarchists. But more progressive opposition must be seen as legitimate, as a traditionally Left effort to protect the weak and to oppose rules that owe their legitimacy only to the fact that they have been posited, without regard to whether they truly benefit a global citizenry. Much of globalization relies on intellectual incoherence, and the cause of Internationalism (certainly not globalization) deserves something more than that.

	",59.0,"Over half a century ago, the New Deal signified a paradigm shift in the American polity. Under the mandate of relief, recovery, and reform, the modern regulatory administrative state was created. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, a new paradigm is emerging that ties together recent developments in the political-economy with advances in legal and democratic theory. This article introduces the new vision as a shift from the traditional New Deal Regulatory model to a Renew Deal Governance model. The article both asserts the emergence of a new model and critically explores the interplay among its various elements. It unpacks the widespread claims of newness in the field of law, asking why legal projects seek to be innovative and to what they respond. At the same time, it offers a comprehensive map for understanding renewal projects collectively, including the internal competition among the possible meanings and interpretations of the emerging paradigm. Integrating into a unified framework central works at the micro-level of doctrine, at the macro-level of administrative and constitutional law, and at the meta-level of jurisprudence, the article explores the possibility of renewal through adoption of a new legal model. Through both theoretical inquiry and case study, the article describes the organizing principles of the governance model, which consist of increased participation of non-state actors, public/private collaboration, diversity and competition, decentralization and subsidiarity, integration of policy domains, flexibility and non-coerciveness (soft law), adaptability and learning, and finally, legal orchestration. These features are closely analyzed in three leading domains of governance - new workplace policies, civic environmentalism, and cyberdemocracy. The article argues that new governance is purposely and ingeniously designed as a school of theoretical and practical hybridization, drawing together elements from rival schools of thought and critical insights concerning both regulatory and market failures. Through the pragmatic synthesis of legal approaches, the governance model confronts the false dilemma of centralized regulation and deregulatory devolution. The article concludes with a discussion of the normative challenges that are evoked in the nascent governance regime of the twenty-first century, and suggests ways in which democracy, accountability, and legitimacy are advanced in the Renew Deal Era.

	",,"Present-day advocates of an ownership society (OS) do not seem to have noticed the means we have already employed to become an OS where homes and human capital (higher education) are concerned. Nor do they appear to have considered whether these same means - which amount to publicly enhanced private credit markets - might be employed to spread shares in business firms, with a view to completing our OS. This article, the third in a series, seeks tentatively to fill that gap. It does so first by demonstrating how the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP, in effect replicates our home and education spreading programs in piecemeal fashion. But piecemeal replication, the article shows, is not sufficient; a completed OS requires complete replication. So the article, second, generalizes from the ESOP along two salient dimensions - what it labels the patronage and credit dimensions - in order both to complete SOP-financing's replication of our federal home- and higher-education finance programs, and with that our OS itself. Our OS is, in effect, a three-legged stool that awaits its third leg.

	",43.0,"Ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs are known for their active business networking practices, particularly in Southeast Asia. This paper empirically investigates the role of ethnic Chinese networks in promoting foreign direct investment (FDI). We further evaluate whether the effectiveness of networking activities are affected by the level of economic and institutional development of the source and the host countries. Using a standard gravity model, we find that ethnic Chinese networks are significant in facilitating cross-border investment between countries. The strength of ethnic Chinese networks between country pairs, approximated by the product of the numbers of ethnic Chinese in both countries, is positively correlated with the cumulative amount of their reciprocal FDI. More importantly, this significant relationship is not limited to countries in Southeast Asia, but is applicable to other country pairs included in the study as well, regardless of whether the investment is originated from industrial countries or developing economies. Finally, the analysis finds no evidence that ethnic networks are only effective in countries where economic and legal institutions are under-developed. Ethnic Chinese networks have played a significant role in promoting FDI to countries with a relatively higher bureaucratic quality, much more so than to countries with a lower bureaucratic quality.

	",,"All modern economies have a ""chartalist"" or ""state"" money, as acknowledged by Friedrich Knapp and J.M. Keynes. In this paper, I examine the ""history"" of money to shed light on its origins. I also examine in detail the views of those who accepted the chartalist, or state, approach to money, from Adam Smith to Knapp and Keynes, with some discussion of the views of Hyman Minsky and Abba Lerner. This is then linked to Lerner's ""functional finance"" approach to money and government spending. I next explore the implications of ""modern money"" for government policy, and show that much economic analysis reaches erroneous conclusions because it fails to recognize the nature of modern money. The state ""defines"" money when it chooses that in which taxes must be paid. Government spending is the most important determinant of the supply of base money; government deficits are the most important source of net money holdings. This stands in stark contrast to traditional analysis, for fiscal policy is the primary determinant of the money supply. On the other hand, monetary policy determines the short term interest rate. Because government deficits increase bank reserves, monetary policy is required to offer an interest-earning alternative to excess reserves; essentially, monetary policy consists of sales of government bonds (by the Treasury and Central Bank) to ""drain"" excess reserves in order to hit the interest rate target established for monetary policy. Thus, bond sales are not a part of fiscal policy, nor are they needed to ""finance"" government deficits. This analysis then leads to several interesting policy conclusions regarding importance of government deficits and debts, as well as proposals to promote full employment.

	",80.0,"This Article is the first academic paper to systematically consider the environmental impact of the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. City of New London and of economic development condemnations more generally. Kelo upheld economic development takings - condemnations that transfer property from one private owner to another solely on the ground that doing so might improve the local economy or increase tax revenue. The decision stands in sharp contrast to the Michigan Supreme Court's ruling in County of Wayne v. Hathcock, which forbade the use of eminent domain for economic development.    
Part I briefly explains the rationales of the Kelo and Hathcock decisions and shows why a Hathcock-like ban on economic development takings is highly unlikely to impede environmental regulation or the use of eminent domain for legitimate conservation purposes. This doctrinal point is buttressed by empirical evidence indicating that none of the nine states with judicial bans on economic development takings have ever used such a ban to strike down the use of eminent domain for environmental or conservation purposes. Part II shows that economic development takings actually threaten environmental harm. Allowing the use of eminent domain for economic development poses a particular threat to private conservation lands and open space. Because land owned by conservation nonprofits produces few economic benefits and does not contribute to tax revenue, it is likely to be targeted by developers and local governments that use eminent domain to advance their development interests. Economic development takings can also damage the environment by promoting environmentally harmful development, undermining property rights, and furthering dubious development plans that sap community wealth and reduce resources available for environmental protection. In many situations, economic development takings end up giving us the worst of both worlds: they cause environmental harm and reduce economic growth by transferring land to inefficient development projects.

	",31.0,"We provide cross-country and time series evidence on the extent of exchange rate pass-through into the import prices of 25 OECD countries. Across the OECD and especially within manufacturing industries, we find compelling evidence of partial pass-through in the short run, rejecting both producer-currency pricing and local currency pricing. Over the long run, producer-currency pricing is more prevalent for many types of imported goods. We show that many countries have experienced changes in exchange rate pass-through over the past decades. While we find that countries with higher rates of exchange rate volatility are also those with higher pass-through elasticities, we also conclude that macroeconomic variables have played only a minor role in accounting for the evolution of OECD pass-through over time.

	",41.0,"The canonical Missouri v. Holland holds that Congress has power to enact legislation to implement a treaty, even if it would lack the power to enact the same legislation absent the treaty. It holds, in other words, that the legislative power may be increased by treaty. This proposition is of enormous theoretical importance, because it is in deep tension with the fundamental constitutional principle of enumerated legislative powers. It is also of great and increasing practical importance, because it lies at the intersection of the two most dramatic trends in American law: the explosion of the United States' commitments under international law on matters of distinctly local concern, and the new willingness of the Supreme Court to police the limits of the enumerated powers of Congress. These two trends, in combination, are creating an increasing gap between what Congress is called upon to do by treaty and what it otherwise has enumerated power to do. It is this widening gap that implicates Missouri v. Holland.  
This Article endeavors to prove that Missouri v. Holland is wrongly decided. It shows, first, that Justice Holmes misunderstood the relationship between the Treaty Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Second, it demonstrates that the standard historical defense of Missouri v. Holland is based on a false premise. It concludes, based on constitutional text, history, and structure, as well as an examination of public choice and practical consequences, that Missouri v. Holland is wrong - treaties cannot increase the legislative power of Congress. Whether or not this Article definitively resolves this issue, however, it should, at a minimum, serve to launch a new debate in the constitutional law of foreign affairs: what is the scope of Congress's power to legislate pursuant to treaty?

	",18.0,"We draw out implications of the identifiable victim effect - the greater sympathy shown toward identifiable than statistical victims - for public finance. We first review research showing (1) that people respond more strongly to identifiable than statistical victims even when identification provides absolutely no information about the victims, (2) that the identifiable victim effect is a special case of a more general tendency to react more strongly to identifiable others whether they evoke sympathy or other emotions, and (3) that identifiability influences behavior via the emotional reactions it evokes. Next, we discuss the normative status of the effect, noting that, contrary to the usual assumption that people overreact to identifiable victims, identifiability can shift people's responses in a normatively desirable direction if people are otherwise insufficiently sympathetic toward statistical victims. Finally, we examine implications of the identifiable victim effect for public finance. We show that the identifiable victim effect can influence the popularity of different policies, for example, naturally favoring hidden taxes over those whose incidence is more easily assessed, since a hidden tax has no identifiable victims. Identifiable other effects also influence public discourse, with much of the debate about government spending and taxation being driven by vivid exemplars - iconic victims and perpetrators - rather than any rational calculation of costs and benefits.

	",80.0,"After twenty-one years of marriage and six children, Theophilus Packard committed his wife, Elizabeth Parsons Ware Packard (1816-1897), to the Jacksonville Insane Asylum because she defied him by publicly expressing her liberal religious beliefs. Elizabeth spent three years in the asylum, and upon her release, she returned home and Theophilus confined her to the nursery. Elizabeth's friends obtained a writ of habeas corpus, and a public trial regarding her sanity ensued. The trial attracted national news coverage and resulted in the exploration and confirmation of Elizabeth's sanity. Elizabeth recognized that in order to effect legal change one must fight on several fronts - in the courts, at the legislative level, and with public education. She utilized the courts when necessary - to gain recognition that she was sane and to gain custody of her children. But she also saw the value in educating the public about her causes (insanity, married woman's property rights, and child custody rights) through her books and the benefits of lobbying legislatures to change laws.    
This Article: (1) explores Elizabeth's early years and how they influenced her later in life; (2) analyzes what led to Elizabeth's commitment, her experience in the insane asylum, and the trial for her freedom; (3) addresses Elizabeth's crusade for the rights of the insane, married women's property and earning rights, and child custody rights; (4) examines Elizabeth's beliefs concerning religion, marriage, and a woman's legal being; (5) delves into how Elizabeth, Charlotte Bronte, and Elizabeth Stoddard, through the act of writing, confronted the male mirror to create their own mirrors; and (5) posits that Elizabeth entered the borderlands - the sites of contestation - as a dormant, hesitant, and daring voyager.    
While certainly there is much merit to the theoretical approaches that have been devised to analyze the lives of nineteenth century women (i.e., domestic, feminist, etc.), such constructs to some extent result in an oversimplification of how women shaped their own self.  Women existed within a diverse and continually shifting world.  Some remained almost exclusively within their private landscape - that of home and children - remaining dormant voyagers. Within the private landscape existed a vibrant world, where these women searched to capture their selves and in many ways constructed a liminal space of empowerment.  Other women attempted to restructure their private landscape in order to gain greater power - these women were hesitant voyagers. They were the women who gained confidence from the private landscape and began to express themselves. Circumstances, or perhaps self-revelation, caused some women to become daring voyagers - that is, women willing to enter the borderlands - the sites of contestation. Suddenly, the private/public dichotomy disappeared for these women as they attempted to capture their selves - in all realms, private and public.    
There is much to be gained from unearthing and grappling with the inconsistencies and intricacies of women's lives during the nineteenth century - in that we can better understand the fluidity of women's lives and how they shaped and were shaped by various forces, including law, religion, and culture.

	",,"In several decisions handed down during its 1999 Term, the United States Supreme Court focused on the freedom of expressive association.  Generally speaking, expressive association is regarded by courts and commentators as just another form of individual self-expression, and voluntary associations as facilitators for such self-expression.    
In this Essay, Professor Garnett suggests that a shift in focus, from individual self-expression-through-association to the expression of voluntary associations themselves.  It is suggested that, in several recent decisions Â­including Dale, Mitchell, and California Democratic Party - the Court has indicated an appreciation of the role played by mediating institutions in shaping citizens, in transmitting values and loyaltiesÂ­that is, in educating.  In this role, associations are not only vehicles for the messages of individuals, but also speakers themselves.  Associations are seen as more than conduits, but as crucial parts of the scaffolding of civil society.  And the messages they express are valued not only to the extent they carry the voices of individuals, but also because they compete with the messages of government in the arena of education, broadly understood.

This has led to what is known as ""reverse discrimination"". Reverse discrimination arises when nationals/products of a Member State are disadvantaged because they are subject to a national measure, while foreign (EU) nationals/products are protected from that national measure by virtue of EC law. In the Guimont judgment of 2000, the ECJ ruled that it will reply to preliminary questions about purely internal situations because a reply ""might be useful"" to the national court ""if"" its national law were to prohibit reverse discrimination. The purpose of this paper is to show that (a) the Guimont principle is (i) misguided and (ii) unnecessary, because it overlaps with the Dzodzi principle; and (b) reverse discrimination is a necessary evil.

	",29.0,"On its official roster of current and former members, the Supreme Court does not list William Cushing as the third Chief Justice of the United States, between Chief Justices John Rutledge and Oliver Ellsworth. It should.    
The accepted view is that Cushing - an Associate Justice from 1790 to 1810 - was nominated, confirmed, appointed, and commissioned as Chief Justice in January 1796, but that he declined the job without ever taking the required oaths or taking office. The historical record supports a different conclusion.    
In the rough minutes of the Court for February 3 and 4, 1796, the Clerk of the Court records Cushing as Chief Justice - and, as the Documentary History of the United States shows, the Clerk never recorded a person's status as a member of the Court until that person had either taken his oaths in Court or provided proof that he had taken the oaths elsewhere. It is true that the fine minutes of the Court for those two days do not show Cushing as Chief Justice, but Joseph Story's qualifications to be an Associate Justice suffer from a similar problem: his oath-taking is recorded in the rough minutes but not in the fine minutes for February Term 1810. Moreover, there are several other recognized Associate Justices - John Blair, Bushrod Washington, John McKinley, Peter Daniel, John Campbell, and Cushing himself - for whom there is no record at all of the required oath-taking. What is sauce for Associate Justices Story, et al., should be sauce for Chief Justice Cushing.    
In addition, the language used by President Washington and the Senate during the appointment process for Cushing's successor, Oliver Ellsworth, reveals that the executive and legislative branches understood Cushing to have been Chief Justice. In particular, they used the word resigned to describe Cushing's departure from the Chief-Justiceship. In a remarkable display of consistency, from 1791 to 1801 the President and Senate invariably used the word resigned in the judicial appointments process when referring to individuals who had entered into and then departed from judicial offices, and the word declined to describe individuals who refused an office without ever entering into it.    
Finally, the correspondence of key players in the federal government in 1796 supports the existence of a Cushing Chief-Justiceship. The most striking evidence is a pair of letters sent by John Adams to his wife Abigail, in which his reports of Cushing's agonized deliberations over whether to be Chief Justice track neatly the rough minutes of February 3 and 4 described above.    
So Cushing was, briefly, Chief Justice. But there are other issues. First, in a letter to Washington dated February 2, Cushing seeks to avoid the job. But the letter was a draft that was almost certainly never sent, and even more certainly had no effect, as shown by the document itself, the correspondence of John Adams and others, and the absence of any version of the letter or mention of it in the federal government's otherwise rather complete record of appointments to the Court in the mid-1790s.    
Second, there is Cushing's return to his Associate-Justiceship - without renomination, reconfirmation, etc. - after being Chief Justice. The only way he could have lawfully returned to being an Associate Justice without running the appointments gantlet again was to retain his Associate-Justiceship while he served as Chief Justice, and it appears that he did just that. Today such a maneuver would be impossible, but the country and its federal government were different then, and in ways that would have made his briefly simultaneous Chief- and Associate-Justiceships constitutional, otherwise legal, and no more unorthodox than several other odd cases in the early republic. The abrogation in the Judiciary Act of 1789 of the doctrine of incompatible offices as it would have applied to members of the Court, and numerous instances of multiple office-holding by Justices and Chief Justices, would also have contributed to the acceptability of Cushing's dual service. Moreover, even if his return to an Associate-Justiceship was defective, it would have no consequences today because his acts as Associate Justice would be valid under the de facto officer doctrine.    
Lastly, there is the question of why the government has not noticed the existence of one of its own highest-ranking officeholders. The answer lies in the treatment of John Rutledge, whose Chief-Justiceship also was ignored until the 1850s, when two biographers gathered the evidence and made the case for his occupation of that office. It is only now, with the publication of the Documentary History of the Supreme Court and the development of a number of searchable databases of key documents, that it has become feasible to assemble and organize evidence of Cushing's Chief-Justiceship.

First, we document the differential pricing of individual equity options versus the market index, and relate it to variations in return skewness. Second, we show how risk aversion introduces skewness in the risk-neutral density. Third, we derive laws that decompose individual return skewness into a systematic component and an idiosyncratic component. Empirical analysis of OEX options and 30 stocks demonstrates that individual risk-neutral distributions differ from that of the market index by being far less negatively skewed. This paper explains the presence and evolution of risk-neutral skewness over time and in the cross-section of individual stocks.

	",35.0,"Taxation is shadow life.  As our culture monetizes more and more life activities, the shadow grows.  This article looks at the potential tax issues arising from a new life activity: online role-playing games in virtual worlds.  Currently, some 12 million people regularly play such games and the number is growing.  Exploring the reach of the Tax Code into virtual world transactions not only responds to the potentially practical needs of millions of U.S. taxpayers, it also permits a reevaluation of core principles of income tax as they interplay with life activities in the context of 21st century American culture.    
This article's central thesis is that while player activity in virtual worlds produces measurable economic value to the player, player activity that occurs solely within the online virtual world is not gross income under the law.  The article argues for a ""cash out"" rule.  Players whose added wealth consists solely in what are defined as ""units of play"" should not be taxed unless and until they convert those units into cash or property that is something other than a unit of play.  Conversely, when the play ceases, taxation begins.  The resulting line-drawing difficulties have nothing to do with player intent nor with ""fun"" and ""games.""  Instead, the issue presented is as old as the Tax Code itself: at what point does economic gain become legal gain?  The new context of virtual words allows for a renewed exploration of how and why the legal concept of ""income"" differs, and indeed must differ, from the economic concept.     
The article proceeds in three parts.  Part I describes the relevant facts of online role-playing games.  It describes two popular virtual worlds which sit at opposite ends of the spectrum of online gaming - World of Warcraft and Second Life - and describes how game-related activity produces economic income.  Part II reviews the basic rules of income tax, focusing on the broadness of the theory of gross income under section 61.  Part II argues that the limits of section 61, whether imposed by Congress, the courts, or the IRS, are best described as operational limits.  Part III applies the basic tax rules to virtual worlds and advances a theory based on ""units of play"" to distinguish between virtual worlds that are games and virtual worlds that are the equivalent of bingo halls or barter clubs.  Using the concept of imputed income, Part III discusses the circumstances under which economic activity in-world involving only trade of virtual goods or services for virtual money will cast a real world tax shadow.

	",4.0,"What limits ought there be on a state's ability to create a homogeneous society, to increase or perpetuate non-diversity, or to create hierarchies within existing diversity? This paper examines those questions with reference to the Lieberman Plan - which proposes to transfer populated territories from Israel to the Palestine in exchange for Jewish settlements on the West Bank - as an abstract exercise in demographic transformation by the state.  
First the article considers if the Lieberman plan would ""work"": Would it create the alterations it proposes, and would those changes achieve a stable, peaceful, even just settlement? It finds that though there is debate about the possible effects, there is little doubt that transfer would alter the state's demography; objections about feasibility are really based on a conviction that transfer is undesirable. Similarly, transfer is fundamentally different from ethnic cleansing or apartheid, since it leaves people where they are and moves borders around them.  
The article then turns to the international standards that might govern the transfer of territory and citizens, to see how they would characterize such a plan. It finds that there is no rule requiring states to condition transfer of territory on the consent of the affected population, and that norms protecting citizenship are considerably more complex than they first appear - even allowing ethnically targeted denaturalization in some cases.  
The article then analyzes the loyalty provisions of the Lieberman Plan, and notes, contrary to the usual normative assumption, that the foundations of citizenship are actually shared identity and values which derive from a habitual or formative link to a given territory, which in turn creates a right to citizenship not in any particular state, but in the one that incidentally is sovereign over that territory. This interaction of citizenship and territory, when considered together with equal protection norms, suggests that the polity has an interest in defining its own territorial scope and thereby its membership. Human rights do not dictate a particular political dispensation; they do not dictate the shape of any polity.  
The article proposes a neo-Wilsonian interpretation of self-determination to explain how transfer might be assimilated to existing norms. The present doctrinal regime is ambiguous, and deliberations about this question sound in the realm of politics. The right of Jews, as a self-defining group, to self-determination might entitle them to reassess their union with the Arab population of Israel and to in effect secede from the existing broader multi-ethnic state. In fact, all two-state solutions implicitly confirm the continued relevance of division of communities along ethnic lines in the Israeli-Palestinian context. Curiously, therefore, the Lieberman Plan is actually one of the more candid and more generous proposals, in that it acknowledges the logic underlying self-determination: that a self-defining community cannot extend its political dominion over another group, but rather must withdraw.  
Finally, the article notes that international law, though it polices excesses by states, is almost entirely silent about the most decisive factor in controlling demography: the fact of state sovereignty over territory.

	",,"Although the traditional economic explanations of insurance underwriting cycles add to our understanding of the phenomenon, as explanations for the cyclical nature of insurance markets they go only so far. While identifiable phenomena such as the ""pricing problem"" (i.e., the inability of insurers to calculate their cost of goods sold at the time a policy is underwritten) and the ""interest rate problem"" (i.e., the dependence of insurers on investment income to generate earnings) can be viewed as immediate causes of the unusual volatility of liability insurance markets, other forces are at work at a more basic, behavioral level - forces that are given particular rein by the lack of certainty inherent in pricing a product designed to indemnify unpredictable future losses. First and foremost is competition for revenue and market share, which as a practical matter drives the day-to-day behavior of underwriters to a far greater degree than concerns with ultimate profitability. Underwriters - like everyone else in business - are motivated by (i) the desire for financial reward and (ii) fear of losing employment or opportunities for advancement. And, during all but the absolute peaks of the underwriting cycle, underwriters are evaluated according to the amount of premium they can generate. The second factor is what can best be described as the ebb and flow of bureaucratic influence within an insurer that accompanies shifts in perceived profitability. The third factor is the influence of insurance agents and brokers on the pricing behavior of insurers, and the consequences of that influence.

	",63.0,"Following the enactment of the Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002, US stock exchanges strongly advocate the presence of financial experts on audit committees. However, the ideal definition of financial expertise proves to be a controversial issue culminating with the stock exchanges adopting a wide scoped definition of financial expertise. Using this definition, prior studies have not provided consistent evidence of financial expertise positively influencing audit committee effectiveness. We investigate the association between three types of audit committee financial expertise (accounting, finance and supervisory expertise) and accruals quality. We find significant positive relation between accounting expertise and accruals quality, which is more pronounced in the presence of strong audit committee governance. The findings indicate that the current definition of financial expertise is too broad and any future refinements must focus on accounting expertise of the audit committee members.

	",47.0,"In this Article, Professor Solove develops a new approach for conceptualizing privacy. He begins by examining the existing discourse about conceptualizing privacy, exploring the conceptions of a wide array of jurists, legal scholars, philosophers, psychologists, and sociologists. Solove contends that the theories are too narrow or too broad. With a few exceptions, the discourse seeks to conceptualize privacy by isolating one or more common essential or core characteristics of privacy. Expounding upon Ludwig Wittgenstein's notion of family resemblance, Solove contends that privacy is better understood as drawing from a common pool of similar characteristics. Rather than search for an overarching concept, Solove advances a pragmatic approach to conceptualizing privacy.    
In Part I, Solove discusses and critiques the conceptions of a wide array of theorists under six general headings, which capture the recurrent ideas in the discourse.  These headings include:  (1) the right to be let alone - Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis's famous formulation for the right to privacy; (2) limited access to the self - the ability to shield oneself from unwanted access by others; (3) secrecy - the concealment of certain matters from others; (4) control over personal information - the ability to exercise control over information about oneself; (5) personhood - the protection of one's personality, individuality, and dignity; and (6) intimacy - control over, or limited access to, one's intimate relationships or aspects of life.    
In Part II, Solove contends that attempts to conceptualize privacy by locating the common denominator to identify all instances of privacy have thus far been unsatisfying. Wittgenstein's notion of family resemblance suggests that there are other ways to conceptualize beyond a search for the common denominator.  Solove develops a pragmatic approach to conceptualizing privacy, seeking to understand privacy in terms of practices.  Privacy is not reducible to a set of neutral conditions that apply to all matters we deem private. Rather, to say that a particular matter is private or to talk about privacy in the abstract is to make a generalization about particular practices. These practices are a product of history and culture. Therefore, we should explore what it means for something to be private contextually by looking at particular practices.  Solove  illustrates these points by looking historically at certain matters Western societies have long understood as private - the family, the body, and the home.    
Next, Solove contends that privacy does not have a universal value that is the same across all contexts. The value of privacy in a particular context depends upon the social importance of the practice of which it is a part.    
Finally, Solove examines some applications of his approach. With a series of examples, he illustrates how privacy law has fixed itself too firmly to certain conceptions of privacy, and, as a result, has lost flexibility in dealing with emerging privacy problems.  He then demonstrates how his approach can help courts conceptualize privacy in ways better adapted to address emerging privacy problems.

	",53.0,"A retrospective of National Wildlife Refuge System conservation shows a promising trajectory. The system has overcome persistent neglect to contribute to conservation policy. Haltingly, it has kept pace with conservation science to remain the chief American contribution to large-scale wildlife protection. Early on, it pioneered the use of habitat acquisition to protect imperiled species. More recently, it has begun to implement the cutting-edge ecological mandate to maintain biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health. Perhaps the most meaningful feature of the history of the refuge system is how closely it mirrors the development of conservation policy in the twentieth century.   
This article reviews the evolution of refuge system management and shows how it reflects the major conservation developments over the past century. It begins by surveying the system with special reference to the Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The article conducts a historical review of conservation policy developments, with particular emphasis on their legal dimensions. It then discusses the current conservation framework for the refuges, which is a form of ecosystem management. The article concludes by observing the ways in which the national wildlife refuges are now the most important federal lands for demonstrating sustainability and ecosystem management on a large scale.

	",23.0,"The federal government, all fifty states, and dozens of foreign countries have enacted computer crime statutes that prohibit ""unauthorized access"" to computers. No one knows what it means to ""access"" a computer, however, or when access becomes ""unauthorized."" The few courts that have construed these terms have offered widely varying interpretations. Several recent decisions suggest that any breach of contract renders an access unauthorized, broadly criminalizing contract law on the Internet.   
In this Article, Professor Orin Kerr explains the origins of unauthorized access statutes, and examines why the early beliefs that such statutes articulated a clear standard have proven remarkably naive. He then shows how and why the courts have construed these statutes in an overly broad manner that threatens to criminalize a surprising range of innocuous conduct involving computers. Finally, Professor Kerr offers a normative proposal for interpreting ""access"" and ""authorization."" Courts should reject a contract-based theory of authorization, and should limit the scope of unauthorized access statutes to circumvention of code-based restrictions on computer privileges. This proposed interpretation best mediates between securing privacy and protecting the liberty interests of Internet users. It also mirrors criminal law's traditional treatment of consent defenses, and avoids possible constitutional difficulties that may arise under the broader constructions that courts have recently favored.

	",42.0,"Despite the large literature on leadership, previous studies have diverged in their assessments of the impact of CEOs on company performance. The debate has focused on the question of ""Does leadership matter?"" The ""leadership"" proponents state that leadership is a critical factor in organizational performance. On the other side of the debate, ""constraints"" researchers argue that leaders are so constrained that they have little impact on company performance. Past empirical studies have failed to satisfactorily resolve the debate. In this paper, we propose that the debate thus far might be misdirected. Instead, the appropriate question should be, ""When does leadership matter?""      
We propose a framework - the ""contingent opportunities view"" - that resolves the debate between the ""leadership"" and ""constraint"" camps, and then test the framework in a quantitative study of the contexts in which CEO leadership matters. We first show that the impact that CEOs can have on company performance differs markedly by industry. We then find that the industries in which CEOs have the most significant impact on performance are those where opportunities are scarce or where CEOs have slack resources. These results have implications for CEO compensation, CEO succession, and stock-market reactions to CEO turnover.

	",,"In the current debate over whether the President has the inherent power to authorize the National Security Agency to monitor international communications with suspected terrorists, one thing is clear - even the most strident opponents concede the need to identify and monitor the communications of terrorists and stop them before they can act.        
Preempting terrorist attacks requires uncovering information useful to anticipate and counter future events.  Automated data analysis technologies can help by monitoring communications and revealing evidence of organization, relationships, or other relevant patterns of behavior indicative or predictive of potential threats, thus allowing law enforcement or security resources to be focused more effectively on likely targets.    
This essay examines certain implications of employing these techniques for foreign intelligence surveillance and suggests that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (""FISA"") is inadequate to address recent technology developments, including: the transition from circuit-based to packet-based communications; the globalization of communications infrastructure; and the development of automated monitoring techniques, including data mining and traffic analysis.

	",,"When analyzing the consequences of and remedies for discrimination against African Americans, courts and scholars characterize African Americans as a minority. This Article shows that the traditional approach is wrong: When it mattered, when the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were enacted and for decades after, African Americans were a majority or controlling plurality in the states where most lived. African American-backed majoritarian governments controlled the South after the Civil War; while in power, they enacted strong civil rights laws and created a public education system. These policies were reversed, and segregation imposed, not because African Americans were a minority, destined to lose in the majoritarian political process, but rather through elimination of democratic politics and imposition of minority rule. African Americans and their white allies were stripped of their electoral majority through fraud, violence and illegal disenfranchisement. This Article argues that the most important harm African Americans suffered was something that the law has until now overlooked: Loss of the right to control the governments of several Southern states. This injury means that current African Americans disadvantage likely rests on a constitutional violation; Jim Crow could not have happened had democracy functioned as provided in the Constitution. Consideration of African American majority status also sheds new light on the counter-majoritarian difficulty. In reviewing measures oppressing African Americans, the Court did not have to balance majority rule against minority rights; instead, majority rule and constitutional rights both militated toward invalidation of laws passed by a minority to oppress the majority.

	",123.0,"This Article begins with a discussion of the prompt complaint requirement, corroboration requirement, and cautionary instructions in the criminal law of rape. These doctrines have greatly weakened in the formal criminal law of the fifty states and the District of Columbia because studies reveal that most victims of rape do not promptly complain to the police or other authorities, most rapes do not produce corroborating evidence, and most jurors are already cautioned by an underlying societal bias against those who claim rape.      
The Article then identifies the emergence of prompt complaint, corroboration, and caution in campus sexual assault policies and practices. It analyzes the current policy at Harvard College, surveys other colleges' and universities' formal policies and informal practices, and explains why campuses would adopt discredited rules from the criminal law in their own disciplinary procedures. The Article then proposes a method to free disciplinary proceedings from the legacy of the prompt complaint requirement, corroboration requirement, and cautionary instructions and proposes model campus sexual assault provisions to effectuate this goal.

We suggest that the processes of various law reform agencies might make them particularly unable to respond effectively to issues that affect women. First, we look at the ways in which law reform questions are asked and answered, and at the generally narrow way in which 'terms of reference' are often framed or constructed. Next, we consider the overemphasis on formal outcomes at the expense of attention to process. Finally, we examine the rather problematic relationship that formal law reform agencies have had, at least at times, with research, empirical data and socio-legal methods. Broadly, we argue that insufficient attention is paid to the real lives of those who interact with, and are impacted upon by, the law and legal system. We conclude with a reminder that even if such agencies were more effective, changes to laws can only ever constitute a small part of any profound social change. Yet for all its faults, we imagine that women will continue to turn to the law, as they have for some time now, as one (albeit limited) forum for addressing women's disadvantage.

	",97.0,"Electromagnetic spectrum is among our largest natural resources. However, while the past few decades have seen a rich body of environmental law develop for other natural resources, this movement has largely passed over the electromagnetic spectrum. This article argues that to remedy that situation, the public-trust doctrine, which is now a cornerstone of modern environmental law, should be extended to electromagnetic spectrum. This extension would not be a leap: the public-trust doctrine has already been used to guarantee the public access to various bodies of water (not just navigable water), and to protect recreational lakes and beaches, wildlife preserves, and even the air. Electromagnetic spectrum is at least as valuable as these other resources, so access to it should be similarly guaranteed in order for the public to enjoy its full potential.    
This article will first show that there is a problem with the way that the electromagnetic spectrum is regulated, that its regulation stifles innovation and has favored incumbents by wrongly giving them exclusive access to a natural resource at no charge, and that the situation has been exacerbated by mistakenly assuming that auctions are a panacea for past spectrum-allocation problems. The article will then argue that the public-trust doctrine, as well as other more general concepts borrowed from environmental-law scholarship - such as sustainable consumption, electromagnetic pollution, and ecological imbalance - should be imported into a new spectrum-management paradigm. Two technologies, Ultra-Wideband and Software Defined Radio may be well-suited for a new regulatory paradigm that is freer than the one that the spectrum has always had, and that provides for access to the spectrum's being guaranteed by the public-trust doctrine.

	",23.0,"This manuscript raises two questions that have been surprisingly missing from the voluminous law review literature on expert evidence since the landmark Daubert decision. First, what is the underlying rationale for the replacement of the old qualifications-only, let-it-all standard for expert testimony with Daubert/Federal Rule of Evidence 702's requirement that all expert testimony be subject to a stringent reliability test? Second, once we have identified this rationale, has the Daubert revolution succeeded on its own terms?     I conclude that the implicit rationale for the reliability test is to preserve the perceived advantages of the adversarial system, while mitigating the harms to the courts' truth-seeking function by the inevitable strong biases that accompany adversarial expert testimony. These biases include the conscious biases of hired guns, the unconscious biases of other paid experts, and the selection biases that result from the fact that attorneys shop for their experts from a large pool of qualified individuals.   Rule 702 thus attempts to serve a worthy goal, but it far from fully succeeds in efficiently achieving this goal. First, in the context of forensic expertise in criminal cases, Rule 702 does nothing to address the huge gaps in resources between the prosecution and most defendants that severely inhibit defendants' ability to challenge unreliable prosecution expert testimony.   Second, Rule 702, applied correctly, does succeed in barring junk science causation evidence in toxic torts cases. However, it does so at the expense of excluding speculative evidence supporting causation, even when most experts in the field would conclude that the relevant evidence is a sufficient basis from which to find causation by a preponderance of the evidence. While Rule 702 is easily preferable to the prior overly permissive regime, it likely goes too far in insisting on a reliability test that makes the courtroom stricter about causation evidence than is the scientific community itself. The way around this problem is to amend Rule 702 to allow courts to admit educated guesses about causation, but only when nonpartisan experts, not subject to adversarial bias, are willing to make such guesses.   Finally, Rule 702 puts severe restrictions on the testimony of experience-based testimony by connoisseurs. Such experts may only testify if their field of expertise is a legitimate one, and they have proven to the court that they truly have the expertise they claim.

	",,"The 1970s were America's only peacetime inflation, as uncertainty about prices made every business decision a speculation on monetary policy.  In magnitude, the total rise in the price level from the spurt in inflation to the five-to-ten percent per year range in the 1970s was as large as the jumps in prices from the major wars of this century. The truest cause of the 1970s inflation was the shadow of the Great Depression.  The memory left by the Depression predisposed the left and center to think that any unemployment was too much, and eliminated any mandate the Federal Reserve might have had for controlling inflation by risking unemployment. The Federal Reserve gained, or regained, its mandate to control inflation at the risk of unemployment during the 1970s as discontent built over that decade's inflation.  It is hard to see how the Federal Reserve could have acquired such a mandate without an unpleasant lesson like the inflation of the 1970s. Thus the memory of the Great Depression meant that the U.S. was highly likely to suffer an inflation like the 1970s in the post-World War II period Ã¾ maybe not as long, and maybe not in that particular decade, but nevertheless an inflation of recognizably the same genus.

	",24.0,"Following their larger counterparts, an increasing number of small firms outsource their IT tasks to lower cost offshore destinations. For small firms, however, offshore outsourcing is a difficult undertaking as it involves high transaction costs. Online marketplaces for IT services, which have recently become available to small firms, make offshore IT outsourcing more accessible and manageable, although differences in the marketplace design result in varying outcomes across the marketplaces. This has consequences for SME's decision as to  which online marketplace to use, because different markets may have different types of benefits and costs. This paper sets to analyze some of the similarities and differences between online marketplaces for IT services and their effects for small firms. First, we analyze if and how online marketplaces reduce small firms' transaction costs in offshore IT outsourcing. Second, we examine the effects of market entry barriers on outcomes of online marketplaces and their implications for small firms. The results indicate that online marketplaces for IT services do reduce transaction costs for small firms in offshore outsourcing across ten specific market processes. More surprising, however, is the finding that the lower market entry barriers for suppliers result in lower prices for buyers without compromising other aspects of market performance.

	",14.0,"This Article proposes a new doctrinal test for assessing the scope of Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. To clarify the muddled state of the law following the Supreme Court's decision in Gonzales v. Raich, the analysis reviews the precedents and shows that the operative standard in implied power disputes comes from the three Legal Tender Cases and not, as is commonly supposed, from McCulloch v. Maryland. Two of these cases on the validity of paper money set forth approaches that are invoked by the Court today.  One says that the Justices should defer to congressional judgments about the affirmative scope of its power absent extraordinary circumstances.  The other says the Court should balance the importance of a federal interest in regulation against any countervailing state interests.  
The third framework discussed in the Legal Tender Cases, however, is not part of the current debate.  That test holds that an exercise of federal power outside the core of an enumerated end should receive heightened scrutiny only when it is in the vicinity of a specific constitutional prohibition (i.e., when there is a colorable claim that a concrete right is affected).  As the Article explains, this test offers a compromise that can protect important structural and textual principles without giving the Court unbounded discretion to displace national action.

Of the fourteen models of optimal portfolio choice that we evaluate across seven empirical datasets, we find that none is consistently better than the 1/N rule in terms of Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return, or turnover. This finding indicates that, out of sample, the gain from optimal diversification is more than offset by estimation error. To gauge the severity of estimation error, we derive analytically the length of the estimation window needed for the sample-based mean-variance strategy to outperform the 1/N benchmark; for parameters calibrated to U.S. stock market data, we find that, for a portfolio with only 25 assets, the estimation window needed is more than 3,000 months, and for a portfolio with 50 assets, it is more than 6,000 months, although in practice these parameters are estimated using 120 months of data. Using simulated data, we further document that even the various extensions to the sample-based mean-variance model designed to deal with estimation error reduce only moderately the estimation window needed to outperform the naive 1/N benchmark. This suggests that there are still many ""miles to go"" before the gains promised by optimal portfolio choice can actually be realized out of sample.

I model a financial institution's (""bank's"") choice between these two strategies in a setting where bank failure is costly and loan monitoring adds value. All else equal, diversification across loan sectors helps most when loans have moderate downside risk and the bank's monitoring incentives are in doubt; when loans have low downside, diversification has little benefit, and when loans have sufficiently high downside, diversification may actually increase the bank's chance of failure. Also, it is likely that the bank's monitoring effectiveness is lower in new sectors; in this case, diversification lowers average returns on monitored loans, is less likely to improve monitoring incentives, and is more likely to increase the bank's chance of failure. Diversified banks may sometimes need more equity capital than specialized banks, and increased competition can make diversification either more or less attractive. These results motivate actual institutions' behavior and performance in a number of cases. Key implications for regulators are that an institution's credit risk depends on its monitoring incentives as much as on its diversification, and that diversification per se is no guarantee of reduced risk of failure.

	",5.0,"Many matters of U.S. election administration have attracted significant popular, political, and scholarly attention in recent years, especially after Bush v. Gore.  Largely slighted, however, has been the matter of how the various state election systems respond when an election outcome is unsettled or contested.  Moreover, some recent electoral reforms, such as widespread provisional balloting and increased use of no-fault absentee voting, actually may increase the frequency with which contested elections occur.  This article explores the complex issues that arise in remedying a failed election, and argues for the refinement and clarification of remedial standards and procedures for dealing with an election dispute.  The article first identifies the primary causes of election failures, as well as the types of remedial options available beyond recounts.  The article next discusses the primary values that should be protected in remedying an unsettled election.  With these values in mind, the article then urges states to reconstitute their remedial processes for failed elections.  First, it recommends much greater specificity in defining the remedies available for particular types of election failure.  It then identifies several additional issues that a state's election contest statute should address with clarity, such as who can contest an election, what evidentiary showings to require, and the time within which a contest should be resolved.  It also recommends empowering non-judicial forums, such as administrative or legislative tribunals, to settle some election contests, and encouraging citizens to adjust their expectations about our election processes - and about the appropriate remedies for failures in these processes - in recognition of the practical impossibility of developing a flawless election system.

Our evidence reveals that firms with declining growth in analyst coverage, falling institutional ownership, and low stock turnover were more likely to go private and opted to do so sooner. We argue that a primary reason behind the decision of IPO firms to abandon their public listing was a failure to attract a critical mass of financial visibility and investor interest.

There seems to be scant literature that looks at PIL from a Law and Economics perspective. This paper sets up a framework to analyze the economic efficiency of public Interest Litigation in the Indian context. We argue that PIL can be justified as an economically efficient choice of redressel if certain conditions are fulfilled. These are, insufficient incentive for private litigation, regulatory failures and the inability of class action to counter harm due to high transaction costs. Thus PIL is seen as an efficient method of bundling interests wherever there are failures of the kind mentioned. We delineate the kinds of economic activity that generate these specific conditions and analyze if PIL has been successful in such cases. We show that PILs filed in India do seem to stem from considerations of Economic efficiency, but there are instances where PIL may be used strategically to pull off private ends and open up a floodgate of litigation.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that the New York Times has a Democratic partisanship, with some ""watchdog"" aspects, in that -during the presidential campaign-- it gives more emphasis to issues over which the (Republican) incumbent is weak. In the post-1960 period the Times displays a more symmetric type of watchdog behaviour, since during presidential campaigns it also gives more more coverage to the typically Republican issue of Defense when the incumbent President is a Democrat, and less so when the incumbent is a Republican.

	",,"Northern Ireland has been variously described as having an 'imperfect peace' in which 'acceptable levels of violence' persist. Despite the endorsement of the main political parties to the principles of 'democracy and non-violence' enshrined in the Belfast Agreement, an insidious and brutalizing form of paramilitary violence continues within communities. The government has opted to 'see no evil, hear no evil' given what is at stake in the wider political process. According to this approach, one must accept certain violent excesses in the interest of moving forward politically. This, however, creates both conceptual and practical problems around the issue of violence in Northern Ireland. By conceding that paramilitaries 'police' the informal criminal justice system in their areas with political and, in most cases, legal impunity, the government, de facto, defines what is 'an acceptable level of violence'. This paper considers the nature and extent of ongoing paramilitary violence, how it has become enmeshed in the negotiated settlement and the consequences of this politicization of violence.

	",38.0,"This article argues that courts should approach the Fourth Amendment with caution when technology is in flux. When a technology is new or developing rapidly, courts should adopt modest formulations of Fourth Amendment protections that recognize the effectiveness and institutional advantages of statutory privacy protections.  
The cautious approach is justified on three grounds. First, caution is consistent with existing judicial practice. The reasonable expectation of privacy test generally has been used by the courts as a term of art that remains closely tied to property law concepts. When a technology implicates privacy but not property, current judicial practice tends to avoid broad interpretations of the Fourth Amendment.    
Second, legislative privacy protections are significantly stronger than most commentators appreciate. The case of wiretapping is instructive. While Fourth Amendment scholars often view wiretapping as a constitutional field under Katz v. United States and Berger v. New York, wiretapping has long been a primarily statutory field. Even today, wiretapping practice is governed by statutory commands, not constitutional ones.  More broadly, Congress has created a wide range of statutory privacy laws that protect privacy in developing technologies where the courts have declined to offer protection.  
Third, legislatures have considerable institutional advantages that enable the legislative privacy rules regulating new technologies to be more balanced, comprehensive, and effective than judicially created rules. Rapid technological change makes it difficult for courts to clarify the law. Courts also lack the institutional capacity to readily appreciate existing technology and the impact of different legal rules. In contrast, courts are well equipped to respond to technological change in the context of criminal procedure rules.

The broad coverage came at a price - in return for a broad list of covered entities, civil rights advocates agreed to a limited set of remedies under ADA Title III.

	",34.0,"What if you could check out of your world, and enter a place where the social environment was different, where real world laws didn't apply, and where the political system could be anything you wanted it to be?  What if you could socialize there with family and friends, build your own palace, go skiing, and even hold down a job there?  And what if there wasn't one alternate world, there were hundreds, and what if millions of people checked out of Earth and went there every day?    
Virtual worlds - online worlds where millions of people come to interact, play, and socialize - are a new type of social order.  In this Article, we examine the implications of virtual worlds for our understanding of law, and demonstrate how law affects the interests of those within the world.  After providing an extensive primer on virtual worlds, including their history and function, we examine two fundamental issues in detail.    
First, we focus on property, and ask whether it is possible to say that virtual world users have real world property interests in virtual objects.  Adopting economic accounts that demonstrate the real world value of these objects and the exchange mechanisms for trading these objects, we show that, descriptively, these types of objects are indistinguishable from real world property interests.  Further, the normative justifications for property interests in the real world apply - sometimes more strongly - in the virtual worlds.    
Second, we discuss whether avatars have enforceable legal and moral rights.  Avatars, the user-controlled entities that interact with virtual worlds, are a persistent extension of their human users, and users identify with them so closely that the human-avatar being can be thought of as a cyborg.  We examine the issue of cyborg rights within virtual worlds and whether they may have real world significance.    
The issues of virtual property and avatar rights constitute legal challenges for our online future.  Though virtual worlds may be games now, they are rapidly becoming as significant as real-world places where people interact, shop, sell, and work.  As society and law begin to develop within virtual worlds, we need to have a better understanding of the interaction of the laws of the virtual worlds with the law of this world.

	",8.0,"Private equity is very much in the public eye.  The prototypical private equity fund purchases, restructures, and resells ailing companies.  The managers of such funds are typically paid with a share of the fund's profits.  Over the last several months, the favorable income tax treatment of these compensatory profits interests has been the subject of an ever swelling stream of headlines, editorials, and Congressional hearings.  But despite the attention the issue has received, the tax advantage of compensatory profit shares is not well understood, and the reasons for reform are, accordingly, not well developed.  This article clarifies the nature of the tax advantage and, with that understanding in mind, critically assesses some of the chief arguments for and against the current tax treatment.

These crimes allow us to study the alternative methods used to kill a large number of people (e.g., shootings versus bombings), marginal deterrence and the severity of the crime, substitutability of penalties, private versus public methods of deterrence and incapacitation, and whether attacks produce ""copycats."" The criminals who commit these crimes are also fairly unusual, recent evidence suggests that about half of these criminals have received a ""formal diagnosis of mental illness, often schizophrenia."" Yet, economists have not studied multiple victim shootings. Using data that extends until 1999 and includes the recent public school shootings, our results are surprising and dramatic. While arrest or conviction rates and the death penalty reduce ""normal"" murder rates and these attacks lead to new calls from more gun control, our results find that the only policy factor to have a consistently significant influence on multiple victim public shootings is the passage of concealed handgun laws. We explain why public shootings are more sensitive than other violent crimes to concealed handguns, why the laws reduce the number of shootings and have an even greater effect on their severity.

	",80.0,"The Internet has completely changed the landscape of the planet. As a result, many areas of the law are being re-thought or re-developed, while other new issues emerge that defy all remotely related regulations. Online gambling is one of those areas in which the laws have lagged behind the technology, and are still in need of an overdue update, along with an official chosen course of action toward bans or regulation. However, as with many other fields, there are developments at our doorstep that stand to turn the concept of internet gambling on its head and re-define the scope of all currently proposed regulations.    
This paper's central thesis is that current gambling regulations do not adequately account for the issue of gambling within Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Rather, these gambling transactions fall into shades of gray between what is and what is not legal.    
The paper proceeds in three parts. First is an overview of gambling regulation. Second, an explanation of the MMO games themselves. From these two elements, the third portion of the paper poses a potential regulatory scheme which could be applied to MMO games to address the issue of MMO gambling more thoroughly than it is presently addressed by any regulation.

The logic of academic freedom, however, cannot be squared with academics who see celebrity and power as more important than the pursuit of truth.  At the least, academic freedom conveys the message that scholars who speak out on public issues know something about those issues.  When academics join forces to send a purely political message, their reputation as truth seekers will diminish and, with it, their credibility.  That day has not yet arrived.  But it is fast approaching. For this very reason academics must hold politically motivated professors accountable for abusing academic freedom.

	",18.0,"The rule of laesio enormis has its origins in ancient Roman law and can be found e.g. in the Austrian Civil Code. Under this rule, a party may seek to have the contract cancelled where the value of the consideration owed by one party is more than double that of the other contracting party. The right would be triggered in the case of the purchase of a painting for a presumed market value of 100, where the true value (the painting is in fact from a famous artist) is 600. Accordingly, the vendee is dissuaded from investing into producing information because he is not guaranteed to recoup the costs he has incurred. By virtue of the laesio enormis rule the buying party will be inclined to offer at least 300; in doing so, he may be giving away valuable information by signalling to the seller that the painting has a higher value. Overall, this results in the underproduction of information and is detrimental for social welfare.

	",,"This article explores current and emerging regulatory approaches to ""second generation"" manifestations of workplace bias.  Second generation bias involves structures and patterns of interaction within the workplace that, over time, exclude members of non-dominant groups. This complex and dynamic type of problems poses a serious challenge for a first generation system that depends on judicial or legislative elaboration of rules, enforced by judicial sanctions for deliberate violations. Over the last decade, an interesting and complex regulatory pattern has emerged to address second generation bias. Multiple public, private and nongovernmental actors are actively and interactively developing systems to address issues such as sexual harassment and the glass ceiling. Each of these institutional actors has begun to approach these questions as posing essentially issues of problem solving. Each has, to varying degrees, linked their anti-bias efforts with the more general challenge of enhancing institutional capacity to manage complex workplace relationships. These multiple actors have, perhaps unwittingly, begun to carve out distinctive roles and relationships that form the outlines of a dynamic regulatory system for addressing second generation discrimination.      
This article offers a framework that makes visible these emerging and converging patterns for addressing second generation discrimination problems in the judiciary, the workplace, and mediating institutions. It explores the potential for a judicially de-centered, holistic, and dynamic approach. This new regulatory approach shifts the emphasis away from primary reliance on after-the-fact enforcement of specific legal rules. Instead, normative elaboration occurs through a fluid, interactive relationship between problem solving within specific workplaces and the courts, mediated by non-governmental actors. In this framework, compliance is defined, achieved through, and  evaluated in relation to improving institutional capacity to identify, prevent, and redress exclusion, bias, and abuse. The article documents examples of this structural approach in the workplace, the courts, and the non-governmental sector, and then extrapolates from these examples to offer a starting point for identifying how internal workplace processes can meet concerns about accountability, legitimacy and effectiveness. In particular, it provides case studies of Home Depot, Intel, and Deloitte & Touche, and analyzes how these initiatives achieve accountability and effective remediation of second generation problems. It also addresses the counter-tendencies and patterns that undercut the viability of this structural approach, and proposes some preliminary steps that encourage the information pooling, capacity building, and accountability mechanisms needed to more fully realize the potential inchoate in the Supreme Court's structural jurisprudence. These proposals highlight the importance of professional and institutional gatekeepers, such as insurance companies, research consortia, human resource practitioners, advocacy organizations, and lawyers, in performing these crucial roles within the emerging regulatory system.

Our evidence thus contradicts the views of many who believe that substantial reinvestment of retained earnings will fuel faster future earnings growth. Rather, it is consistent with anecdotal tales about managers signaling their earnings expectations through dividends or engaging, at times, in inefficient empire building.

	",170.0,"Patent law today is a complex institution in most developed economies and the appropriate structure for patent law is hotly debated around the world. Despite their differences, one crucial feature is shared by the diverse patent systems of the industrialized world even before the recent trend toward harmonization: modern patent regimes include self-imposed restrictions of executive and legislative discretion, which we refer to as ""constitutionalized"" systems. Given the lucrative nature of patent monopolies, the long history of granting patents as a form of patronage, and the aggressive pursuit of patronage in most societies, the choice to confine patents within a legal framework that minimized the potential for gain by current office holders requires explanation. Why choose to constitutionalize patents?    
This paper answers these questions by examining three salient constitutionalizng events through the lens of public choice theory.  First, the ground breaking Venetian statute of 1474, the first modern patent system; second, the British experience with patents that led to the 1624 Statute of Monopolies, one of the key foundations of the U.S. patent system; and lastly, the American Founders' adoption of Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution, which grants the power to, and sets forth the manner in which, the national government can issue patents.  We argue that creating constitutional patent law institutions offered the opportunity to both increase the durability of the bargain between the state and the inventor and, in some cases, to limit the grant of patents to those most likely to increase the general welfare.    
Based on the historical analysis, we derive three desirable features for patent law institutions:    
(1) strong constraints on the type of patents that can be issued, limiting them to areas in which there is evidence that the costs of the limits to competition imposed are justified by the benefits produced by the incentives created;    
(2) an independent institution capable of reviewing the grant of a patent in a timely and final manner, to ensure the constitutional bargain is kept; and    
(3) patents that provide their owners with a sense of security in the validity and scope of their property right, to maximize the value of the bargaining chip offered to inventors.    
Our analysis thus offers lessons for countries considering new patent law institutions or modifying existing ones.

	",46.0,"We explore the flow-performance interrelation by explicitly separating the investment and divestment decisions of hedge fund investors. The results show that different determinants and evaluation horizons underlie both decisions. While money inflows are sensitive to past long-run performance, outflows exhibit an immediate and sustained response to past performance in the short run. As a consequence, the shape of the flow-performance relation differs depending on the time horizon being analyzed. We find a weaker flow-performance relation for winning funds at quarterly horizons compared to annual horizons, which may explain why quarterly persistence in hedge fund performance is not competed away. Indeed, we also find evidence that most investors are unable to exploit the persistence of the winners. Conversely, investors are fast and successful in deallocating from the persistent losers, ensuring a disciplining mechanism for lowquality funds. Further, our findings do not support the existence of smart money.

	",43.0,"Physicians' insuring practices influence their incentives to take care when treating patients, their risk of making out-of-pocket payments in malpractice cases, and the adequacy of compensation available to injured patients. Yet, these practices and their effects have rarely been studied. Using Texas Department of Insurance data on 9,525 paid malpractice claims against physicians that closed 1990-2003, we provide the first systematic evidence on levels of coverage purchased by physicians with paid liability claims and how those levels affect out-of-pocket payments and patient compensation. We find that these physicians carried much less insurance than is conventionally believed, that their real primary limits declined steadily over time, that policy limits often act as effective caps on recovery, and that personal contributions by physicians to close claims were rare. Our findings call into question a number of common assumptions about the relationship between physician insuring practices and the medical malpractice liability system.

Consistent with the market efficiency hypothesis that the anomalies are chance results, apparent over-reaction to information is about as common as under-reaction. And post-event continuation of pre-event abnormal returns is about as frequent as post-event reversal. Consistent with the market efficiency prediction that apparent anomalies can also be due to methodology, the anomalies are sensitive to the techniques used to measure them, and many disappear with reasonable changes in technique.

	",,"In recent years, originalism as a method of interpretation has grown in its intellectual and practical appeal. The latest challenge to originalism from nonoriginalists is based on the doctrine of precedent. Acceptance of originalism, it is charged, would necessitate the reversal of crucially important landmark decisions and thereby provides a reductio ad absurdum of originalism. Until recently, few originalists have considered carefully the relationship between originalism and the doctrine of stare decisis (though this situation is starting to change). In this short essay, I contend that original meaning should indeed trump previous Supreme Court decisions that are inconsistent with the original meaning of the Constitution. But the main thrust of the essay explains why this implication is not as radical as it sounds because there remains much room for the doctrine of precedent in originalism. It is not incompatible with original public meaning originalism to adhere to precedent in cases involving (a) nonconstitutional issues, (b) matters of constitutional construction, (c) detrimental reliance by identifiable individuals, (d) epistemic concerns about the correctness of originalist claims, and perhaps also (e) where the text was originally ambiguous. Knowing the degree to which a commitment to originalism entails the rejection of the doctrine of precedent may well influence the degree to which originalism is deemed acceptable by academics, judges, and the general public. For this reason, it is important to make clear that a commitment to following original meaning where it conflicts with judicial precedent is far less radical a stance than critics of originalism, and perhaps even some originalists, assume.

	",18.0,"This paper critiques the role of credit ratings and credit rating agencies in providing information about bonds. The dominant ""reputational capital"" view of credit rating agencies is that the agencies have survived and prospered since the early 1900s based on their ability to accumulate and retain reputational capital (i.e., good reputations) by providing valuable information about the bonds they rate. The paper argues that this view fails to explain, and is inconsistent with, certain types of market behavior including: the estimation of credit spreads, the number of credit ratings-driven transactions, and the explosion in use of credit derivatives.    
In place of the reputational capital view, the paper offers a ""regulatory license"" view of rating agencies as generating value, not by providing valuable information, but by enabling issuers and investors to satisfy certain regulatory requirements. The paper concludes that regulators should eliminate regulatory dependence on credit ratings by substituting a regime based on market-determined bond credit spreads (i.e., the difference between the yield on a bond and the yield on a risk-free bond of comparable maturity). Such credit spreads reflect all available information, including credit ratings, and therefore are more accurate and reliable than credit ratings.

The major effect of deliberation was to make group members more extreme than they were when they started to talk. Liberals became more liberal on all three issues; conservatives became more conservative. As a result, the division between the citizens of Boulder and the citizens of Colorado Springs were significantly increased as a result of intragroup deliberation.

	",28.0,"In 1993, Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code was passed into law.  The intent of this law was to reign in outsized executive compensation by eliminating the tax-deductibility of executive compensation above $1 million unless the excess compensation was performance-based. One unintended consequence of the legislation was that executives' total compensation actually increased in the post-1993 period.  One compensation package component whose use dramatically increased, as expected, following the adoption of Section 162(m) was performance-based employee stock options.  Employee stock options, however, have unintended consequences of their own. For example, the economic value of performance-based stock options may be influenced by executive decision-making when the options are valued using the Black-Scholes model or some variant thereof. This study investigates whether the incentives embedded in stock options are associated with such unintended consequences as increased market volatility and reduced dividend yields.  Using data from the Standard and Poor's ExecuComp Database, empirical results for the period 1992 through 2004 reveal a significant, positive relation between the quantity of options held by CEOs and share price volatility, and a significant, negative relation between the quantity of options held by CEOs and dividend yields.  These results suggest that executives used their discretion to positively impact the performance-based component of their compensation through actions affecting share price volatility and dividend yields, assumptions implicit in option-valuation models.

	",,"While Australia's colonial links with the United Kingdom were largely terminated by the Imperial Conferences of the 1920s and the Statute of Westminster 1931, the Australian States remained 'self-governing colonial dependencies of the British Crown' until the Australia Acts 1986 came into force.  The States deliberately retained their links with the United Kingdom as a counter-balance to Commonwealth power.  They believed that the British Government was politically disinterested in State matters and acted merely as the formal channel of communication in State matters.      
This belief was proved to be incorrect in the 1970s when the British Government exercised independent discretion in relation to the appointment and removal of State Governors, State petitions to the Privy Council and reserved State Bills.  The States were spurred on by this revelation to seek to terminate their residual links with the United Kingdom, but only if they could directly advise the Queen.  This paper describes the struggle for the decolonisation of the Australian States.  It then discusses two important issues that arise as a result of this process of decolonisation.

	",,"Bush v. Gore was a straightforward and legally correct decision. For more than a quarter century, the Supreme Court has treated the stuffing of ballot boxes as a paradigmatic violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Much more subtle and indirect forms of vote dilution have also been outlawed. Like some of those practices, the selective and partial recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court may have been an inadvertent form of vote dilution. But that recount had effects that were virtually indistinguishable from those in the paradigmatic case. There is no meaningful difference between adding illegal votes to the count and selectively adding legal votes, which is what the Florida court was doing. The Supreme Court rightly concluded that the vote dilution in this case violated well-established equal protection principles.    
Nor did the Supreme Court err in its response to this constitutional violation. Although the Court acted with unprecedented dispatch after the Florida court's December 8, 2000 decision, it was highly improbable that a legally proper recount could be conducted by the December 18 deadline set by federal law. And it was quite impossible for such a recount to meet the December 12 deadline that the Florida court itself had found in Florida law. Contrary to a widespread misconception, the U.S. Supreme Court properly accepted the Florida court's interpretation of state law and provided that court with an opportunity to reconsider its own interpretation of state law. When the clock ran out, it was entirely due to mistakes and delays attributable to the Florida court.    
The Supreme Court's majority opinion has been subjected to a barrage of political criticisms of a kind that might more fittingly be directed against a Senate Majority Leader or a Secretary of State. Ironically, it is precisely because the Justices correctly applied the law that they have been accused of having partisan motives.

	",,"Bushell's Case, 24 Eng. Rep. 1006 (C.P. 1670), established that jurors may not be fined or imprisoned for returning a verdict that conflicts with the judge's assessment of the evidence.  Chief Justice John Vaughan's opinion did not defend jury nullification - in fact, the opinion asserted that jurors must follow the judge's directions concerning the law - but the opinion has long been recognized as a crucial resource for those who advocate nullification. Modern defenses of jury nullification that draw on Bushell's Case often point to Vaughan's argument that jurors must be permitted to form their own views because reasonable people may disagree about a witness's credibility or the reliability of the evidence. In the 1680s, however, when Bushell's Case was first being publicly debated, commentators focused primarily on Vaughan's argument that because jurors were chosen from the locality where the crime occurred, they should be presumed to have personal knowledge of the facts of the case. By the late seventeenth century, however, this premise was untenable.  This article considers why the ""personal knowledge"" argument might have been so appealing, despite its implausibility, and examines the process by which that justification for jury nullification gave way to the ""independent assessment"" argument. In the course of the movement from the first justification to the second one, Bushell's Case began to viewed as supporting the jury's right to find both fact and law - a right that Vaughan had never defended.

	",21.0,"For robust detection performance, alerting algorithms for biosurveillance require input data free of trends, day-of-week effects, and other systematic behavior. Time series forecasting methods may be used to remove this behavior by subtracting forecasts from observations to form residuals for algorithmic input. We describe three forecast methods and compare their predictive accuracy on each of 16 authentic syndromic data streams. The methods are (1) a nonadaptive loglinear regression model using a long historical baseline, (2) an adaptive regression model with a shorter, sliding baseline, and (3) the Holt-Winters method for generalized exponential smoothing. Criteria for comparing the forecasts were the rootmean-square error, the median absolute percent error (MedAPE) and the median absolute deviation. The median-based criteria showed best overall performance for the Holt-Winters method. The MedAPE measures over the 16 test series averaged 16.5, 11.6, and 9.7 for the nonadaptive regression, adaptive regression, and Holt-Winters methods, respectively. The nonadaptive regression forecasts were degraded by changes from the data behavior in the fixed baseline period used to compute model coefficients. The mean-based criterion was less conclusive because of the effects of poor forecasts on a small number of calendar holidays. The Holt-Winters method was also most effective at removing serial autocorrelation, with most 1-day-lag autocorrelation coefficients below 0.15. The forecast methods were compared without tuning them to the behavior of individual series. We achieved improved predictions with such tuning of the Holt-Winters method, but practical use of such improvements for routine surveillance will require reliable data classification methods.

In this paper I use the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey from 1996 through 2002 to ask whether this helped to reduce the gender wage gap. I first focus on those whose wages are paid in full. Next, I ask about the gender composition of wage arrears as the overall extent of wage arrears dropped from 60 to 20 per cent after the 1998 crisis. I show that a temporary widening of the overall gender wage gap in 2000 is due to low-wage women becoming more likely to receive their wages in full than low-wage men.

	",3.0,"People are often reluctant to make decisions by calculating the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action in particular cases. Knowing, in addition, that they may err, people and institutions often resort to second order strategies for reducing the burdens of, and risk of error in, first order decisions. They make a second order decision when they choose one from among such possible strategies. They adopt rules or presumptions; they create standards; they delegate authority to others; they take small steps; they pick rather than choose. Some of these strategies impose high costs before decision but low costs at the time of ultimate decision; others impose low costs both before and at the time of ultimate decision; still others impose low costs before decision while exporting to others the high costs at the time of decision. We assess these second-order strategies and provide grounds for choosing among them in both legal and nonlegal contexts, by exploring the extent to which they minimize the overall costs of decision and costs of error. We also attempt to cast light on political, legal, and ethical issues raised by second-order decisions.

	",26.0,"Existing theories advocate the exclusive use of equity-like instruments in executive compensation. However, recent empirical studies document the prevalence of debt-like instruments such as pensions. This paper justifies the use of debt as efficient compensation. Inside debt is a superior solution to the agency costs of debt than the solvency-contingent bonuses and salaries proposed by prior literature, since its payoff depends not only on the incidence of bankruptcy but also firm value in bankruptcy. Contrary to intuition, granting the manager equal proportions of debt and equity is typically inefficient. In most cases, an equity bias is desired to induce effort. However, if effort is productive in increasing liquidation value, or if bankruptcy is likely, a debt bias can improve effort as well as deter risk shifting. The model generates a number of empirical predictions consistent with recent evidence.

	",50.0,"A series of anticipated (extra) period profits is the ultimate result of a strategic investment. It starts with generating cash and after deduction of value differences and taxes, net profit remains. Period profit, share capital (embedded value - what really is present), shareholder value (economic value - what might happen, additional to the existing activities or 'the market value of the company's shares') and cash flows, are all inter-related.  
DCF (Discounted Cash Flow), P/L-accounts and shareholder value form a trinity, exemplified by an integral calculation. Anyone can learn to put this trinity to one's good use. All can be understood easily. The problem definition in this paper is exceptionally simple really, but is nevertheless realistic. It is inclusive of interest costs and tax costs but price changes are disregarded.  The aim is to present the core of the algorithm, to teach what and how in order to perform basic computations, starting from scratch. It ends up in user-friendly tools of management that are applicable also in small and medium-sized undertakings. This paper contains usage instructions, indicates some refinements and offers various starting-points to make calculations as far as one likes to go. Of course in practice, compilations must cope with all economical and other insights, with the whole reality. No matter how complex the reality is (for instance 'profit' is a N-dimensional quantity), one cannot deviate an inch from it. However unlikely something may be, if it cannot be excluded beforehand then the solution to the problem in hand must be prepared for it.  In fact account must be taken for everything imaginable. Reality indeed is complex and complicated. The problem area is immense and is seemingly a deterrent. Difficult? On the contrary, it is simple. Anyone can understand what it is all about by just counting money.  
On the basis of basic data concerning tax rate, standard gearing, standard cost of capital, and other necessary starting data, including of course the expected cash flows, one can quite easily determine the extra value of a company and equivalently NPV (Net Present Value) of an additional investment as well as resulting P/L-accounts, balance sheets and statements of source and use of funds. Shareholder value can also be calculated. All can be done in a very easy way.

	",,"This article examines the disconnect between the judicial approach to the legal concept of inequality of bargaining power in contract law and the analysis of power in general by the social sciences, negotiators, military strategists, businesspeople, and politicians. As a consequence of this disconnect, courts have ignored how bargaining power is actually used by contracting parties. Instead, courts focus upon crude heuristics such as the availability of meaningful alternatives, opportunities for negotiation, and a series of fixed, status-based party characteristics to assess relative bargaining power disparities. As a result, small businesses, middle-income consumers and similar entities have been largely denied access to contract doctrines that employ the legal concept of inequality of bargaining power (explicitly or implicitly), including unconscionability, adhesion contract analysis and, to a lesser extent, duress, fraud, parol evidence, consideration and public policy analysis. This article recommends that courts begin to assess power imbalances in contract relationships as complex and dynamic influences subject to radical changes throughout the parties' interaction.

	",33.0,"The state secrets privilege has played a central role in the Justice Department's response to civil litigation arising out of post-9/11 policies, culminating in a controversial decision by Judge T.S. Ellis concerning a lawsuit brought by a German citizen - Khaled El-Masri - whom the U.S. allegedly had rendered (by mistake) from Macedonia to Afghanistan for interrogation. Reasoning that the entire aim of the suit is to prove the existence of state secrets, Judge Ellis held that the complaint had to be dismissed in light of the privilege. The government also has interposed the privilege in connection with litigation arising out of the NSA's warrantless surveillance program, albeit with mixed success so far.    
These events amply demonstrate the significance of the state secrets privilege, but unfortunately much uncertainty remains regarding its parameters and justifications. Is it being used by the Bush administration in cases like El-Masri, as some critics have suggested, in a manner that breaks with past practice, either in qualitative or quantitative terms?      
I address these questions through a survey of the origin and evolution of the privilege, compiling along the way a comprehensive collection of state-secrets decisions issued since the Supreme Court's seminal 1953 decision in United States v. Reynolds (the collection appears in the article's appendix). With respect to the quantitative issue, I conclude that there is little point to the inquiry in light of the variation in the number of occasions for asserting the privilege from year to year.  With respect to the qualitative issue, I find that the Bush administration does not differ from its predecessors in its use of the privilege.  Since the early 1970s the privilege has frequently been the occasion for abrupt dismissal of lawsuits alleging government misconduct. Recognizing that the privilege strikes a harsh balance among the security, individual rights, and democratic accountability interests at stake, however, I conclude with a discussion of reforms Congress might undertake if it wished to ameliorate the privilege's impact. In particular, I suggest that (i) opportunities exist to provide assistance to judges in assessing the potential impact of disclosures and (ii) even where the privilege properly attaches special procedures might be adopted to permit litigation to continue in a classified, quasi-adversarial setting, at least where unconstitutional government conduct is alleged.

	",153.0,"Ecological models of the determinants of health and the consequent importance of structural interventions have been widely accepted.  Operationalizing these models in research and practice has been challenging.  Examining the role of criminal law enforcement in the ""risk environment"" of injection drug users (IDUs) provides an opportunity to apply structural thinking to the health problems associated with drug use.  This paper reviews international evidence that laws and law enforcement practices influence IDU risk. It argues that more research is needed at four levels - laws; management of law enforcement agencies; knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices of front-line officers; and attitudes and experiences of IDUs - and that such research can be the basis of interventions within law enforcement to enhance IDU health.

The fact that a significant number of corporations are committing resources to risk management activities is, however, only an indication for the potential of corporate risk management to increase firm value. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of positive theories and their empirical evidence regarding the contribution of corporate risk management to shareholder value. It is argued that because of realistic capital market imperfections, such as agency costs, transaction costs, taxes, and increasing costs of external financing, risk management at the firm level (as opposed to risk management by stock owners) represents a means to increase firm value to the benefit of the shareholders.

We investigate the ways in which geography may matter directly for growth, controlling for economic policies and institutions, as well as the effects of geography on policy choices and institutions.  We find that location and climate have large effects on income levels and income growth, through their effects on transport costs, disease burdens, and agricultural productivity, among other channels. Furthermore, geography seems to be a factor in the choice of economic policy itself.  When we identify geographical regions that are not conducive to modern economic growth, we find that many of these regions have high population density and rapid population increase.  This is especially true of populations that are located far from the coast, and thus that face large transport costs for international trade, as well as populations in tropical regions of high disease burden.  Furthermore, much of the population increase in the next thirty years is likely to take place in these geographically disadvantaged regions.

	",41.0,"This Article deconstructs code using case studies and shows that code is not neutral and apolitical but instead embodies the values and motivations of the institutions and actors building it.  The term ""code,"" as we use it, consists of the hardware and software components of information technologies.  Code is increasingly being sought as a regulatory mechanism in conjunction with or as an alternative to law for addressing societal concerns such as crime, privacy, intellectual property protection, and the revitalization of democratic discourse.  Our analysis examines how societal institutions, such as universities, firms, consortia, and the open source movement, differentially influence the production of code.  Relying on four case studies, we analyze how institutions differ in structure and motivation, and how they are affected by different social, political, economic, and legal influences.  We then analyze how these societal institutions, which all approach code creation differently, influence the technical and social characteristics of the code that is developed by them.  For example, code developed by a university is likely to contain different values and biases, regarding societal concerns such as privacy, than code developed by a firm.  This analysis provides a crucial first step in understanding how society shapes these new technologies.  Ultimately, this work may assist policymakers in proactively shaping the development of code to address societal concerns.

We study this phenomenon using a unique dataset of hedge fund activism for the period 1994-2005, and find evidence that hedge fund activists improve both short-term stock performance and long-term operating performance of their targets.  The most dramatic changes in performance accrue to targets where activists seek corporate governance changes and reductions in excess cash.  Additionally, hedge funds themselves benefit from activism: the risk-adjusted annual performance of hedge funds seeking changes in corporate governance is about 7-11% higher than for non-activist hedge funds and hedge funds pursuing less aggressive activism.  These results imply that hedge funds can facilitate long-lasting changes in corporate governance, cash flows, and operating performance that benefit target firm shareholders and hedge fund investors alike.

Yet, the theoretical and practical importance of developing and applying dynamic capabilities to sustain a firm`s competitive advantage in complex and volatile external environments has catapulted this issue to the forefront of the research agendas of many scholars. In this paper, we offer a definition of dynamic capabilities, separating them from substantive capabilities as well as from their antecedents and consequences. We also present a set of propositions that outline (1) how substantive capabilities and dynamic capabilities are related to one another, (2) how this relationship is moderated by organizational knowledge and skills, (3) how organizational age affects the speed of utilization of dynamic capabilities and the learning mode used in organizational change, and (4) how organizational knowledge and market dynamism affect the likely value of dynamic capabilities.

	",47.0,"For more than a century, legal scholarship on the duty to rescue has proceeded on a sophisticated theoretical plane. Proponents of a duty to rescue have argued that it will decrease the frequency of non-rescue without creating undue distortions or other difficulties. Opponents of a duty to rescue have argued that such statutes are ineffective, infringe on individual liberties, may actually discourage rescue, and are likely to be misused by politically ambitious prosecutors. No effort has been made to test any of these claims empirically, even though from a policy perspective, the critical threshold question - how often do Americans fail to rescue one another in circumstances where only a generalized duty to rescue would require them to do so - is entirely factual. This article provides the first empirical study of the no-duty rule in action. Using more than twenty independent data sources, the article provides a ""law and reality"" perspective on rescue and non-rescue that complicates - and sometimes is flatly inconsistent with - the positions of both proponents and opponents of a duty to rescue. The results paint a rich and largely reassuring picture of the behavior of ordinary Americans faced with circumstances requiring rescue, and indicate that both more and less is at stake in the debate over the no-duty rule than has been commonly appreciated. Law professors and judges have been fascinated with the no-duty rule for theoretical reasons, but the ongoing debate should not obscure the reality that in the real world, rescue is the rule - even if it is not the law.

	",,"A long line of United States Supreme Court cases have followed the methodology of Neilson v. Harford in requiring novelty, and also often non-obviousness, to come entirely from the parts of the claim that are statutory under what is now Section 101 of the 1952 Patent Act. This paper traces the development of subject matter law in the area of software patents, where loss of the Neilson test led to contradictory holdings and de facto legitimization of supposedly nonstatutory subject matter. It proposes to restore stability and substance to subject matter law with a return to the Neilson doctrine, in a modern form consistent with the 1952 Patent Act.

	",,"In recent years many banks have attempted to improve the measurement and management of credit risk by assigning risk ratings to business loans. Virtually all large banks now assign such ratings. However, until recently there has been little information on the use of risk ratings by smaller banks. Recent revisions to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Terms of Business Lending and telephone consultations with more than 100 banks on the survey panel provide data on the prevalence and precision of risk rating systems at banks of all sizes. We find that the use of risk rating systems is quite widespread, but that smaller banks generally have less detailed systems than do larger banks. In addition, the new survey data allow us to asses the relationships between loan risk ratings and loan terms. Not surprisingly, riskier loans generally carry higher interest rates, even after taking account of other loan terms. There are more complex relationships between loan risk and other loan terms. Regression results indicate that banks of all sizes price for risk. We do not find a relationship between reported loan risk and delinquency and charge-off rates. However, this may reflect how recently the risk rating data have become available.

Yet, the theoretical and practical importance of developing and applying dynamic capabilities to sustain a firm's competitive advantage in complex and volatile external environments has catapulted this issue to the forefront of the research agendas of many scholars. In this paper, we offer a definition of dynamic capabilities, separating them from substantive capabilities as well as from their antecedents and consequences. We also present a set of propositions that outline (1) how substantive capabilities and dynamic capabilities are related to one another, (2) how this relationship is moderated by organizational knowledge and skills, (3) how organizational age affects the speed of utilization of dynamic capabilities and the learning mode used in organizational change, and (4) how organizational knowledge and market dynamism affect the likely value of dynamic capabilities. Our discussion and model help to delineate key differences in the dynamic capabilities that new ventures and established companies have, revealing a key source of strategic heterogeneity between these firms.

Because the planners -- meaning bureaucrats in the ministries and managers of firms -- cannot keep the official profits that firms earn, it is in their interest to create shortages of output and to collect bribes from the rationed consumers. Unlike official profits, bribes are not turned over to the state, and so shortages enable the key decision makers who collect them to profit personally. The theory suggests that an increase in the official price of a good might reduce output. The theory also suggests that market socialism is bound to fail even without computational complexities facing the planners.

	",64.0,"In the early 1900's American financial institutions were active participants in U.S. corporate governance but the enactment of securities laws in the 1930's limited the power of financial intermediaries and thus their governance role. The consequence of such laws and regulations was a progressive widening of the gap between ownership and control in large U.S. public companies. In 1942, SEC rule changes allowed shareholders to submit proposals for inclusion on corporate ballots.  Since that time, shareholder activists have used the proxy process, and other approaches, to pressure corporate boards and managers for change. In particular, during the mid-1980s, the involvement of large institutional shareholders increased dramatically with the advent of public pension fund activism. At the heart of shareholder activism is the quest for value, yet the empirical evidence suggests that effects of such activism are mixed. We review the evidence on activism and, while some studies have found positive short-term market reactions to announcements of certain kinds of activism, there is little evidence of improvement in the long-term operating or stock-market performance of the targeted companies.  A recent increase in hedge fund activism appears to be associated with dramatic corporate change, however, the research in this area is still somewhat nascent and the long-term effects are still unknown.

	",3.0,"Justice is a natural virtue. Well-functioning humans are just, as are well-ordered human societies. Roughly, this means that in a well-ordered society, just humans internalize the laws and social norms (the nomoi) - they internalize lawfulness as a disposition that guides the way they relate to other humans. In societies that are mostly well-ordered, with isolated zones of substantial dysfunction, the nomoi are limited to those norms that are not clearly inconsistent with the function of law - to create the conditions for human flourishing. In a radically dysfunctional society, humans are thrown back on their own resources - doing the best they can in circumstances that may require great practical wisdom to avoid evil and achieve good. Justice is naturally good for humans - it is part and partial of human flourishing. All of these are natural ethical facts.    
""Natural Justice"" develops these claims in four stages. Part I contextualizes the claim that justice is a natural virtue in relationship to Hume's famous argument about deriving ought from is, Moore's open-question argument, and the so-called fact-value distinction. The upshot of the discussion in Part I is the claim that there are no clearly decisive objections to existence of natural ethical facts.    
Part II traces the movement from neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics to virtue jurisprudence by articulating a theory of the judicial virtues. Among these are the virtues of practical wisdom and of justice. Practical wisdom or phronesis is best understood on the model of moral vision, which in the context of law is legal vision or situation sense. The virtue of justice is best understood as lawfulness. Just humans are law-abiding or nomimos - in that they internalize the widely shared and deeply held social norms of their social groups. This part concludes with the claim that a legally correct decision is the decision that characteristically would be rendered by a fully virtuous judge under the circumstances of the case.    
Part III argues that natural justice can be understood on the model of natural goodness as articulated in the work of Philippa Foot and Michael Thompson. The intuitive idea is that justice as lawfulness is naturally good for reason - using social creatures in human circumstances. This part also articulates and responds to a variety of objections.    
Part IV concludes by articulating the sense in which an aretaic theory of law that incorporates a natural virtue of justice as lawfulness can be viewed as an expression of the natural law tradition. The natural law idea that an unjust enactment is not a true law corresponds to two senses in which positive laws can fail to be nomoi (in the technical sense specified by virtue jurisprudence). First, a given enactment may contravene deeply held and widely shared social norms. Second, such enactments may be fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose of law - the promotion of human flourishing.

A group of well-meaning national and international bureaucracies dispensed foreign aid under conditions in which bureaucracy does not work well. The hostile environment under which such aid agencies functioned induced them to organize a cartel that increased inefficiency and reduced effective supply of development services, frustrating the good intentions and dedication of development professionals. The cartel of good intentions allows rich country politicians to feel that they are doing all in their power to help the world's poor, supports rich nations' foreign policy goals, preserves a panoply of large national and international institutions, and provides resources to poor country politicians with which to buy political support; in short, foreign aid works for everyone except for those whom it was intended to help. Now rich countries are using their past lack of effort at assuring effective aid as an excuse to reduce aid. Instead, to change this unhappy equilibrium, policymakers in rich and poor countries should experiment with decentralized markets to match those who want to help the poor with the poor themselves freely expressing their needs and aspirations.

	",,Portfolio resampling is a very general and powerful technique to show the dispersion of optimized portfolio weights that arises from estimation error in inputs. Investors should however be aware of potential pitfalls when applying resampling techniques in order to arrive at better portfolios as resampling might deliberately create biases into the portfolio construction process. If short sales are allowed the concept of resampled efficiency will only add noise to optimal portfolios. In case of long only constraints resampling tends to include dominated assets into optimal allocations. Volatility becomes here an attractive feature as it increases the dispersion in resampled inputs and leads to upwards biased allocations. Assets either enter the optimal solution or they don't but they are never shorted. ,,https://ssrn.com/abstract=796625,https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/Announcements-Jobs/,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=796625,,," G0, G1",6,2,2,0,0

Our model assumes full protection of intellectual property rights at all stages of the development process, and hence does not rely on lack of appropriability or spillovers to generate a rationale for academic research. Instead, we focus on control-rights considerations, and argue that the fundamental tradeoff between academia and the private sector is one of creative control versus focus. By serving as a precommitment mechanism that allows scientists to freely pursue their own interests, academia can be indispensable for early-stage research. At the same time, the private sector%u2019s ability to direct scientists towards higher-payoff activities makes it more attractive for later-stage research.

	",55.0,"The Supreme Court has long given its cases interpreting statutes special protection from overruling. Two rationales exist for this practice. One line of thought interprets congressional silence following the Supreme Court's interpretation of a statute as approval of that interpretation. According to this way of thinking, a refusal to overrule statutory precedent is a refusal to veer from an interpretation that Congress has effectively approved. Another line of thought emphasizes that statutory interpretation inevitably involves policymaking, and that policymaking is an aspect of legislative, rather than judicial, power. According to this second way of thinking, the Supreme Court should refuse to revisit its statutory interpretations as a means of encouraging Congress (and other interested parties) to use the democratic rather than the judicial process to resolve the policy questions that lie at the heart of interpretive disputes.    
A robust literature exists debating the wisdom of the Supreme Court's statutory stare decisis doctrine. That robust literature, however, has wholly overlooked a curious aspect of super-strong statutory stare decisis: the courts of appeals have adopted it too. Scholars of statutory interpretation have not noticed the appearance of this doctrine in the lower courts, and the logic of its presence there is not immediately apparent. In this Article, I explore whether statutory stare decisis is an example of an interpretive practice in which the Supreme Court and the lower courts should diverge. I argue that in the courts of appeals, as in the Supreme Court, the theory emphasizing the connection between statutory stare decisis and the separation of powers provides far more credible support for the doctrine than does a theory of congressional acquiescence. Nevertheless, even the separation-of-powers theory does not justify super-strong statutory stare decisis in the courts of appeals. To the extent that statutory stare decisis operates as a restraint on judicial policymaking, it does so based on assumptions about how Congress will react to the Supreme Court. It is both impractical and inconsistent with the system of appellate review that Congress has designed for the inferior courts to assume that Congress will respond to them in the same way. Whatever the merits of statutory stare decisis in the Supreme Court, I conclude that the inferior courts have no sound basis for following the Supreme Court's practice.

	",,"In 1982, James Q. Wilson and George Kelling suggested in an influential article in the Atlantic Monthly that targeting minor disorder could help reduce more serious crime. More than 20 years later, the three most populous cities in the U.S. - New York, Chicago and, most recently, Los Angeles - have all adopted at least some aspect of Wilson and Kelling's theory, primarily through more aggressive enforcement of minor misdemeanor laws. Remarkably little, though, is currently known about the effect of broken windows policing on crime.    
According to a recent National Research Council report, existing research does not provide strong support for the broken windows hypothesis - with the possible exception of a 2001 study of crime trends in New York City by George Kelling and William Sousa.     
In this paper, we re-examine the Kelling and Sousa 2001 study and independently analyze the crime data from New York City for the period 1989-98. In addition, we present results from an important social experiment known as Moving to Opportunity (MTO) underway in five cities, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles as well as Baltimore and Boston, which provides what is arguably the first truly rigorous test of the broken windows hypothesis. Under this program, approximately 4,800 low-income families living in high-crime public housing communities characterized by high rates of social disorder were randomly assigned housing vouchers to move to less disadvantaged and disorderly communities. The MTO program thus provides the ideal test of the broken windows theory.     
Taken together, the evidence from New York City and from the five-city social experiment provides no support for a simple first-order disorder-crime relationship as hypothesized by Wilson and Kelling, nor that broken windows policing is the optimal use of scarce law enforcement resources.

This paper examines the effects of work-related training on direct measures of productivity. Using a new panel of British industries 1983-96 and a variety of estimation techniques we find that work-related training is associated with significantly higher productivity. A 1% point increase in training is associated with an increase in value added per hour of about 0.6% and an increase in hourly wages of about 0.3%. We also show evidence using individual-level data sets that is suggestive of training externalities. ,,https://ssrn.com/abstract=920949http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0084.2006.00170.x ,https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/Announcements-Jobs/,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=920949,"Wiley-Blackwell: Oxford Bulletin of Economics & Statistics,IO: Productivity, Innovation & Technology eJournal,Labor: Human Capital eJournal","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=306438,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=1475473,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=1480991",,176,204,2,0,0

The method uses parametric representations of the early exercise decisions and consists of two stages.

Furthermore, using the simulation model proposed, we present an empirical pricing study of the US market, using 32 convertible bonds and 69 months of daily market prices. Our results do not confirm the evidence of previous studies that market prices of convertible bonds are on average lower than prices generated by a theoretical model.

	",160.0,"Legal scholarship on behavioralism and the implications of cognitive biases for the law is flourishing.  In parallel with the rise of such commentary, legal scholars have begun to discuss the role of the emotions in legal discourse.  Discussion turns on the ""appropriateness"" of various emotions for the substantive law, and on attempts to model the place of the emotions in the law.    
Implicit in some of these theories, however - and explicit in others - is the assumption that emotions are ""predictable,"" ""manageable,"" and (for some commentators) under conscious control.  This assumption is belied by psychological research on affective forecasting that demonstrates individuals' inability to accurately predict future emotional states, both their own and others'.    
Such inaccuracy has surprisingly broad implications for both substantive and procedural aspects of the legal system.  The research findings also demonstrate the implausibility of some theoretical models of the emotions; if these models are flawed, then the normative conclusions drawn from them may be flawed as well.    
In this Article I review the psychological data demonstrating inaccuracies in affective forecasting, and spin out their implications in a number of substantive legal areas.  The data show potential flaws in the way civil juries assign compensatory awards, and in our approach to certain aspects of sexual harassment law.  The findings have profound implications for the presentation of victim impact statements to capital juries, but also undercut some abolitionist claims regarding the suffering that death row prisoners experience.  Contract law is implicated by these findings, especially in the context of contracts for surrogate motherhood.  And the data are relevant to areas of health law as well - for instance, regarding the use of advance directives broadly as well as in the specific context of euthanasia.    
I also discuss broader issues, such as the implications of the affective forecasting research for theories of law and the emotions more broadly.  In this discussion I include some of the specific drawbacks to some current theories.  In addition, I address the data's implications for the very theories of welfare and well-being that underlie much legal policy, as well as some speculations about what the findings might have to say about potential paternalistic policies.

	",24.0,"The California Law Revision Commission has been working for ten years on administrative law reform.   This work resulted in one solid success--enactment in 1995 of a new Administrative Procedure Act for adjudication.   The new APA modernized California's APA by providing an administrative law bill of rights for litigants before agencies not covered by prior law.  It also introduced some important reforms such as informal hearings and alternate dispute resolution.  The Law Revision Commission also suffered two ignominious failures: its judicial review reform bill was killed in a state senate committee and a modest set of rulemaking reforms passed the legislature but was vetoed by the governor.     
This article analyzes the politics of state administrative procedure law reform in California, identifying the relevant players and pointing out the pitfalls that any state administrative law reform is likely to encounter.   Reformers must enlist a powerful political patron to back the project and must be prepared to  compromise until virtually all serious opposition is neutralized.  They must articulate a powerful intellectual case for reform, in order to counter the cliche ""if it ain't broke don't fix it.""  In particular, there must be some benefit in the reform package for state agencies so that they have a reason to buy in.  For example, a provision for informal hearings or a provision that allows an agency to adopt precedent decisions without going through rulemaking might be attractive to agencies.    
Agencies will staunchly resist reforms that increase their costs (for example, by required rulemaking)  or reduce their autonomy or power  (for example, by stripping them of their administrative law judges or diminishing their ability to overturn ALJ findings).   Similarly, the private sector will resist reforms that diminish procedural or judicial review protections.  Many people will mistrust and misunderstand any reform effort.  In the nature of the political process, it is easy to kill legislation (especially when generous campaign contributors are trying to kill it) and hard to pass it.  Therefore, reformers must be as inclusive as possible during the drafting of legislation so that all major players can have input into the process.  It will often be necessary in this process  to scale back ambitious reform proposals and make timely compromises.  Failure to recognize these realities of political life doomed the Law Revision Commission's judicial review bill.    
The article surveys existing Pennsylvania administrative law which is relatively primitive.  The waves of reform marked by the 1961 and 1981 Model State Administrative Procedure Acts have largely passed Pennsylvania by.   The lack of statutory law has forced Pennsylvania courts to reform administrative procedure by applying the state constitution. These decisions seem ill-informed and they unduly constrain the legislature.  On the other hand,  Pennsylvania's system of uniform administrative procedural rules is a significant innovation.   Pennsylvania administrative law needs updating, but the process of achieving reform will be tedious and difficult.  The California experience should prove valuable to Pennsylvania as it undertakes this process.

	",18.0,"Sustained large U.S. current account deficits have led some economists and policymakers to worry that future current account adjustment could occur through a sudden and disruptive depreciation of the dollar and a sharp drop in U.S. consumption. Two factors that, to date, have cast doubt on such concerns are the stability of U.S. net external liabilities and the minimal net income payments made by the United States on these liabilities. We show that the stability of the external position reflects sizable capital gains stemming from strong foreign equity markets and a weaker dollar Â— conditions that could be reversed in the future. We also show that while minimal U.S. net income payments reflect a much higher measured rate of return on U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) assets than on U.S. FDI liabilities, ongoing borrowing is likely to overwhelm this favorable rate of return, pushing the U.S. net income balance more deeply into deficit.

Using evidence drawn from primary and secondary sources, the piece documents the simple claim that the executive power is the power to execute the law. The piece also underscores that the founding generation universally understood that the President would superintend federal law execution. Finally, the piece attempts to make sense of the other constitutional provisions that are often deemed relevant to law execution and suggests how to harmonize these provisions with the essential meaning of executive power.

	",25.0,"This paper exploits nationalistic biases in Olympic winter sports judging to study the problem of designing a decision-making process that uses the input of potentially biased agents. Judges score athletes from their own countries higher than other judges do, and they appear to vary their biases strategically in response to the stakes, the scrutiny given the event, and the degree of subjectivity of the performance aspect being scored. Ski jumping judges display a taste for fairness in that they compensate for the nationalistic biases of other panel members, while figure skating judges appear to engage in vote trading and bloc judging. Career concerns create incentives for judges: biased judges are less likely to be chosen to judge the Olympics in ski jumping but more likely in figure skating; this is consistent with judges being chosen centrally in ski jumping and by national federations in figure skating. The sports truncate extreme scores to different degrees; both ski jumping and, especially, figure skating are shown to truncate too aggressively. Extreme truncation not only discards information, but may also make the vote trading in figure skating easier to implement. These findings have implications for both the current proposals for reforming the judging of figure skating and for designing decision making in organizations more generally.

	",,"Churches often bear the burden of the Internal Revenue Code's electioneering prohibition without their contributors enjoying the benefit of a tax deduction.  Although contributions to religious congregations may be deducted, many, perhaps most of them, are not because many of those who give to churches do not itemize their income tax deductions.  In the past two years, Congress has had before it several bills that would permit nonitemizing taxpayers to deduct their charitable contributions.  This Article argues that extending the deduction to nonitemizers raises important issues of tax policy that should concern religious organizations.  The author contends that religious congregations will benefit from considering some of the difficult questions about the relationship of the charitable contribution deduction to the standard principles of tax policy.  If they do, they might support either a deduction only above a floor or a charitable contribution credit rather than a 100% deduction for nonitemizers.

Chain store opponents, including Justice Louis Brandeis, argued that the chains were undermining the small, independent retailer and destroying America's small towns, and that the concentration of economic capital in large corporate entities threatened democratic citizenship. These localist and decentralist arguments were taken seriously by state legislatures, many of which adopted anti-chain store tax laws, and by Congress, which adopted amendments to the federal antitrust laws. This Article revives these arguments in order to describe a progressive, localist constitutionalism that has been lost since the late New Deal.

	",23.0,"Racing to the top of the corporate hierarchy is difficult, no matter how qualified or capable the candidate. Producing more widgets than one's competitors is not enough. Negotiating the political landscape of the institution is also required. More specifically, individual corporate officers have to be appeased, powerful interest groups have to be co-opted and made allies, and competitors have to be undermined or eliminated. The more bureaucratic the organization and the more opaque the promotion process, the more important this institutional game to climbing the corporate ladder. This Article identifies the kind of racial minorities or racial types who are likely to play this game well and, consequently, race to the top of the corporation.    
Identifying these racial types is crucial to making corporations more welcoming to and comfortable for racial minorities. This is because the racial minorities at the top of the corporation (successful racial types) are in an institutional position to perform discrimination-ameliorative tasks for those on the bottom. Thus, many corporate governance and employment discrimination scholars rest some of their hope for the establishment of colorblind corporate cultures on the assumption that successful racial types will actively seek out and perform antidiscriminatory institutional work.    
However, there is reason to believe that the racial minorities at the top of the corporate hierarchy will neither racially reform the corporation, nor engage in door-opening activities, for the minorities on the bottom. Indeed, strong incentives exist for minorities to race to the top of the corporate hierarchy and pull the ladder up behind them when they get there. This Article sets forth the nature of these incentives, reveals how they help to produce particular racial types, and explains why these racial types might not have the racial commitment, or feel institutionally empowered, to lift as they climb.

	",6.0,"As the 110th Congress begins to flex its atrophied oversight muscle it bears reminding in the ongoing debate over who should have the authority to authorize and oversight foreign intelligence surveillance programs, that someone must, and the existing mechanisms, in particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (""FISA"") and its related procedures, are no longer adequate and must be updated.  The FISA simply did not anticipate the nature of the current threat to national security from transnational terrorism, nor did it anticipate the development of global communication networks or advanced technical methods for intelligence gathering.     
New technologies do not determine human fates but they do alter the spectrum of potentialities within which people act. This article examines how technology and certain related developments have enabled new threats and new response mechanisms that challenge existing policy constructs and legal procedures in the context of foreign intelligence surveillance.  This article does not argue that these developments justify abandoning long-held bedrock principles of democratic liberty - nor even that some new  ""balance"" between security and liberty need be achieved - rather, it argues that familiar, existing oversight and control mechanisms - including FISA - or their analogues can be applied in these novel, technologically-enabled circumstances, but only if the challenges and opportunities are better understood and the laws and procedures updated to accommodate needed change.      
This article is organized into six parts: this Introduction, four descriptive sections, and a brief Conclusion.  Section I: Foreign Intelligence Surveillance: A Brief Overview provides a very brief introduction to the relevant parts of the FISA regime; Section II: Changing Base Conditions describes the changing nature of the threat, the shift to preemptive strategies in response, and the need for surveillance to support preemption; Section III: The Ear of Dionysus describes the nature of modern communication networks and certain related technology developments, and examines how three situations - transit intercepts, collateral intercepts, and automated monitoring - cannot be accommodated by FISA as currently constituted (this section also briefly speculates on certain aspects of the NSA Terrorist Surveillance Program and the January 10, 2007 FISC orders); and, Section IV: Fixing Foreign Intelligence Surveillance suggests some potential solutions that preserve existing Fourth Amendment principles and protections while still addressing these failures.   Finally, the Conclusion reiterates the need to get beyond backward looking recriminations and to craft progressive consensual solutions.

We find that the independence of the audit committee and whether the committee meets at least four times per year exhibit a significant and negative association with the occurrence of financial reporting restatements. We also document a significant positive association between an audit committee that lacks a member with financial expertise and the occurrence of financial reporting restatements. However, only audit committee independence and the lack of financial expertise exhibit a negative (positive) association with financial reporting fraud. Our results underscore the importance of the BRC's first two recommendations, both of which concern audit committee independence.

Investment necessary to replenish oil reserves is costly and irreversible. We solve for the optimal consumption, production and oil reserves policy for a representative agent. We analyze the equilibrium price of oil, as well as the term structure of oil futures prices. Because investment in oil reserves is irreversible and costly, the optimal investment in new oil reserves is periodic and lumpy. Investment occurs when the crude oil is relatively scarce in the economy. This generates an equilibrium oil price process that has distinct behavior across two regions (characterized by the abundance/scarcity of oil). We undertake three empirical tests suggested by our model. First, we estimate key parameters using SMM to match moments of oil price futures as well as other macro-economic properties of the data. Second, we estimate an affine regime switching model of the oil price, which captures the main features of our equilibrium model and preserves the tractability of reduced-form models. Lastly, we compare the risk premium in oil futures implied by our model to the data.

	",78.0,"China's Internet filtering regime is the most sophisticated effort of its kind in the world. Compared to similar efforts in other states, China's filtering regime is pervasive, sophisticated, and effective. It comprises multiple levels of legal regulation and technical control. It involves numerous state agencies and thousands of public and private personnel. It censors content transmitted through multiple methods, including Web pages, Web logs, on-line discussion forums, university bulletin board systems, and e-mail messages. Our testing found efforts to prevent access to a wide range of sensitive materials, from pornography to religious material to political dissent. We sought to determine the degree to which China filters sites on topics that the Chinese government finds sensitive, and found that the state does so extensively. Chinese citizens seeking access to Web sites containing content related to Taiwanese and Tibetan independence, Falun Gong, the Dalai Lama, the Tiananmen Square incident, opposition political parties, or a variety of anti-Communist movements will frequently find themselves blocked. Contrary to anecdote, we found that most major American media sites, such as CNN, MSNBC, and ABC, are generally available in China (though the BBC remains blocked). Moreover, most sites we tested in our global list's human rights and anonymizer categories are accessible as well.

	",31.0,"Exchange rate regime optimality, as well as monetary policy effectiveness, depends on the tightness of the link between exchange rate movements and import prices. Recent debates hinge on whether producer-currency-pricing (PCP) or local currency pricing (LCP) of imports is more prevalent, and on whether exchange rate pass-through rates are endogenous to a country's macroeconomic conditions. We provide cross-country and time series evidence on both of these issues for the imports of twenty-five OECD countries. Across the OECD and especially within manufacturing industries, there is compelling evidence of partial pass-through in the short-run- rejecting both PCP and LCP. Over the long run, PCP is more prevalent for many types of imported goods. Higher inflation and exchange rate volatility are weakly associated with higher pass-through of exchange rates into import prices. However, for OECD countries, the most important determinants of changes in pass-through over time are microeconomic and relate to the industry composition of a country's import bundle.

	",2.0,"Sexual assaults are punished as serious felonies, often resulting in the lengthiest terms of incarceration meted out by the state.  When the perpetrator is an adult and the victim is a child, many states further enhance the penalty for sexual assault by increasing the minimum available sentence and creating more stringent conditions for release.      
However, many states offer a discounted criminal charge to perpetrators of child sexual assault who are related to their victims. Loopholes written into state laws permit related perpetrators who have been convicted to escape penalties which would otherwise be mandatory for child sexual offenders, including imprisonment, mandatory sentence enhancements, and sexual offender registration. Prosecutors may offer probation-only sentences and forms of judicial diversion available only to related perpetrators. In some cases, the convicted perpetrator may return to live in the home of the child-victim.    
The article employs a problem-solving methodology rooted in critical outsider theory to critique these loopholes in state child protective systems as dangerously unsound policy. Using California as a case study, the article details the laws that authorize a prosecutor to permit convicted child sexual offenders to sidestep the charges, penalties, and administrative safeguards required by state law, as long as they are related to their victims. It examines the legal history of state incest laws and the social and political responses during the last century to the problem of sexual abuse of children in their homes. Criminal and medical studies are adduced to demonstrate that related and non-related perpetrators cannot be differentiated, either in their criminal acts or their psychological makeup. The article concludes with model legislation drafted to correct the flaws identified in state penal code.

	",14.0,"This report documents the historical rating transition and default rates of Moody's-rated debt issuers conditional on lagged rating actions, rating outlooks, and rating reviews. We primarily seek to answer three questions, each addressed in its own section of this special comment. First, we ask how different are rating transition and default rates conditional on rating history and outlook/Watchlist status, where each is considered in isolation? Second, does rating outlook/Watchlist status fully summarize transition and default risk within each rating category? Or does rating transition and default risk still depend in part on rating history once conditioned on outlooks and reviews? Finally, we investigate whether the information content of Moody's credit ratings is increased by recognizing the information contained in rating outlooks and reviews. The study finds that rating outlooks and Watchlist assignments greatly enhance the predictive power of credit ratings. The accuracy ratio - a commonly used metric for evaluating the ability of a rating system to predict defaults - was found to be greatly improved by conditioning credit ratings on rating outlooks and reviews. Adjusting credit ratings on review for upgrade or downgrade by two notches and adjusting ratings for outlook status by one rating notch raised the accuracy ratio to 70.9% from 64.8% unconditionally. More aggressive adjustments for outlooks and reviews and additional adjustments for rating history had much more limited effects, increasing the accuracy ratio by only an additional 0.5%.

	",22.0,"At the end of 1997, the foreign companies listed in the U.S. have a Tobin's q ratio that exceeds by 16.5% the q ratio of firms from the same country that are not listed in the U.S. The valuation difference is statistically significant and largest for exchange-listed firms, where it reaches 37%. The difference persists even after controlling for a number of firm and country characteristics. We propose a theory that explains this valuation difference. We hypothesize that controlling shareholders of firms listed in the U.S. cannot extract as many private benefits from control compared to controlling shareholders of firms not listed in the U.S., but that their firms are better able to take advantage of growth opportunities. Consequently, the cross-listed firms should be those firms where the interests of the controlling shareholder are better aligned with the interests of other shareholders. The growth opportunities of cross-listed firms will be more highly valued than those of firms not listed in the U.S. both because cross-listed firms are better able to take advantage of these opportunities and because a smaller fraction of the cash flow of these firms is expropriated by controlling shareholders. We find that our theory explains the greater valuation of cross-listed firms. In particular, we find expected sales growth is valued more highly for firms listed in the U.S. and that this effect is greater for firms from countries with poorer investor rights.

	",27.0,"A large fraction of business groups around the world are run by families. In this paper, we analyze how the structure of the families behind these business groups affects the groups' organization, governance and performance. To address this question, we constructed a unique data set of the family trees and the business groups they run for 70 of the largest business families in Thailand. We show that the group head and his brothers hold the majority of family positions within each group. However, we also find a positive relationship between family size and involvement of family members in the business group, especially when the ultimate control has passed from the founder to one of his descendants. Interestingly, groups that are run by larger families (more male siblings of the group head) tend to have lower performance. This negative performance effect coincides with a larger number of small firms in these group, more fragmented internal capital markets and possibly more tunneling along the pyramidal structure of the groups. These performance and within-group resource allocation effects are again especially pronounced in groups where the founder is no longer active and ultimate control has been passed to one of his descendant. One hypothesis that emerges from our analysis is that part of the decay of family-run groups over time may be due to in-fighting for group resources as control becomes more diluted among different family members.

In a two-country, two-differentiated-goods monetary model, demand, supply, and monetary (as well as exchange rate) shocks arise after wages are set and prices are optimally chosen. The paper finds that countries are more specialized under flexible than fixed rates, and that the pattern of specialization is not uniquely defined by trade models but depends also on the exchange rate regime. The adoption of fixed exchange rates endogenously increases the desirability of this currency area by reducing the shock asymmetry.

	",3.0,"This short contribution to the Connecticut Law Review's new online supplement, CONNtemplations, offers some thoughts on status and gatekeeping in the online age of legal scholarship.  Bloggers, SSRN, and online law review supplements like this one have increasingly routed around and weakened, if not undermined, the traditional gatekeepers who certified legal scholars and their scholarship.  Is this a good thing?      
The paper proceeds by examining this question in light of a pair of opposing views and values.  The first is Julius Getman's discussion of the eternal tension between elitism and egalitarianism in the life of the scholar.  The second is a pair of comments on the role of blogs and other online media in legal scholarship - a positive and optimistic comment by Larry Solum, and a more pessimistic and critical view presented by Brian Leiter.  Ultimately, I tend to agree with Solum's optimistic view: the online age has provided new thinkers and writers with multiple routes around the old gatekeepers, and this development should be welcomed.      
At the same time, I suggest candidly that many legal scholars who have benefited from blogs and other online media (including myself) have used those new media to seek certification and enhanced status from the same traditional gatekeepers that we have criticized.  In Getman's terms, we have talked egalitarianism and done elitism.  The old tension continues.  I link this tension to a variety of broader phenomena: the insecurity of the legal academic, the legal academy's increasing fixation with rankings, and the economy of prestige.

	",,"The view (most prominently advocated by Justice Scalia) that original meaning entails the constitutionality of original practices has strong intuitive appeal. Indeed, as indicated above, it is a position that has been broadly, if implicitly, assumed by originalists and nonoriginalists alike. But the position is mistaken. We will suggest that a failure to distinguish between two different notions of meaning accounts for the position's wide currency. According to the first notion, the meaning of a term is roughly what a dictionary definition attempts to convey - the semantic or linguistic understanding necessary to use the term, as opposed to nonlinguistic facts about the objects or activities to which the term applies. In contrast, according to the second, looser notion, the meaning of a term incorporates the objects or activities to which the term is applied. The first notion lies behind originalism's theoretical force; it is untenable that the meaning of the Constitution in the first sense could evolve. In sharp contrast, it is not only tenable but inevitable that changes occur over time in the class of things to which a constitutional provision is applied.    
The assumption that originalism entails the validity of original practices derives its plausibility from a failure to distinguish between the two notions of meaning. Once recognized, the distinction undermines the seemingly natural move from the necessity of interpreting the Constitution in accordance with how it was originally understood to the necessity of upholding practices originally understood to be constitutional. By taking the distinction on board and rejecting the assumption, originalism can readily deflect the challenges based on unacceptable original practices; as a consequence, however, it will not be tenable for originalism, in any case challenging an original practice, simply to rule out the possibility of the practice's invalidity.

	",6.0,"This study examines the change in entering class median LSAT, a key input into the U.S. News & World Report rankings, between 1993 and 2004. Using multivariate regression analysis, the authors model several factors that can influence the direction and magnitude of this change. The study presents six specific findings: (1) the market for high LSAT students is divided into two segments that operate under different rules; (2) initial starting position is a strong predictor of the future gain or loss in LSAT scores; (3) the allure of the high-end corporate law firms appears to cause a significant portion of students to discount the importance of rankings in favor of locational advantages related to the regional job market; (4) students will pay a tuition premium to attend elite law schools but, when deciding among non-elite schools, are willing to forgo a higher ranked school for lower tuition, thus producing a measurable gain in median LSAT scores for lower priced, non-prestigious law schools; (5) there is little or no association between change in lawyer/judge and academic reputation and median LSAT scores, and (6) two well-known gaming strategies for driving up median LSAT scores appear to work.   
Drawing upon these results, the authors suggest that the current rankings competition among law schools has all the hallmarks of a positional arms race that undermines social welfare. The authors outline the emerging equilibrium in which non-elite schools engage in costly strategies to boost their reputations while elite law schools are able to further leverage their positional advantage. Because this dynamic spawns rapidly escalating costs in the form of higher tuition, continuation of the ranking tournament threatens the long-term viability of the current model of legal education. The authors conclude with four specific recommendations to law school deans and the editors of U.S. News & World Report.

	",120.0,"All deliberate speed, the remedial formula adopted in Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294 (1955), has a singularly interesting literary lineage. Contrary to Justices Holmes and Frankfurter's assumption, all deliberate speed is not a phrase from the traditional language of the English Chancery, but rather a variant on a line from an 1893 poem by Francis Thompson, The Hound of Heaven. How Thompson's line, ""Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,"" came to dominate one of the defining moments in American constitutional law represents a unique instance of not law-in-literature or law-as-literature, but literature-as-law. By turning our analysis away from the romanticized origins of all deliberate speed in a Chancery practice that never existed and toward the real poetry of Francis Thompson, we may glimpse how all deliberate speed and the Brown litigation achieved a measure of poetic justice. Brown II's instruction that public school districts dismantle desegregation with all deliberate speed gave Brown I's vision of equal justice under law enough time and enough legitimacy to enter the hearts and minds of the American people in a way unlikely ever to be undone.

	",3.0,"This article argues that the debate between originalism and living constitutionalism offers a false dichotomy. Many originalists and their critics improperly conflate fidelity to the original meaning of the constitutional text with fidelity to how people living at the time of adoption expected that it would be applied. That is, they confuse original meaning with original expected application.    
Constitutional interpretation requires fidelity to the original meaning of the Constitution and to the principles that underlie the text, but not to original expected application. This general approach to constitutional interpretation is the method of text and principle. This approach is faithful to the original meaning of the constitutional text, and to its underlying purposes. It is also consistent with the idea of a basic law that leaves to each generation the task of how to make sense of the Constitution's words and principles in their own time. Although the constitutional text and principles do not change without subsequent amendment, their application and implementation can. That is the best way to understand the interpretive practices characteristic of our constitutional tradition and the work of the many political and social movements that have transformed our understandings of the Constitution's guarantees. It explains, as other versions of originalism cannot, why these transformations are not simply mistakes that we must grudgingly accept out of respect for settled precedent, but are significant achievements of our constitutional tradition.    
The article applies this method to the most contentious constitutional issue of our generation - the constitutional right to abortion. It concludes, contrary to conventional wisdom, that the constitutional right to abortion is consistent with the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, in particular, its prohibition on class legislation that is embodied in the Equal Protection Clause.    
The article criticizes Roe v. Wade's original trimester system, arguing that there are actually two rights to abortion instead of one. Finally, it explains how courts might have better implemented the constitutional guarantee of the two rights to abortion in ways that are more respectful of democratic politics.

	",26.0,"Many observers believe that there is something seriously wrong with the current state of the judicial confirmation process, particularly that it features too much conflict and obstruction. This Article does not take sides on whether reform is necessary or desirable but instead examines the relatively neglected issue of the vehicle through which reform might take place - that is, the method of implementing whatever reform (if any) is thought appropriate. In particular, this Article will take up the question whether the confirmation process could be reformed not through the vehicles that are usually proposed - a constitutional amendment, a change to internal Senate rules, an informal deal or norm - but instead through the mechanism of a statute that would govern the Senate's procedures. The statute might, for example, purport to bar filibusters of judicial nominations. While employing a statute might at first seem peculiar, there is in fact a significant, growing, and interesting body of statutory law that governs internal rules of debate.     
Is a statute a permissible method of reform in this context? This Article canvasses various potential impediments to employing a statute and concludes that the Constitution would not permit a statute to override the Senate's ordinary power to control its rules of debate. The reason that such a statute could not formally bind is that it would violate a structural principle of cameral procedural autonomy that is critical to the constitutional design. The Article nonetheless suggests that a confirmations statute might still have practical political effect even if it cannot be legally binding.

	",106.0,"This year marks the tenth anniversary of California's enactment of the nation's first chemical castration law.  This law requires certain sex offenders to receive, as part of their punishment, long-term pharmacological treatment involving massive doses of a synthetic female hormone called medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).  MPA treatment is described as chemical castration because it mimics the effect of surgical castration by eliminating almost all testosterone from the offender's system.  The intended effect of MPA treatment is to alter brain and body function by reducing the brain's exposure to testosterone, thus depriving offenders of most (or all) capacity to experience sexual desire and to engage in sexual activity.  The procedure also carries severe side effects, including drastic reduction in sperm count, irreversible loss of bone mass, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary embolism and depression, to name but a few.  Despite numerous predictions that this law would be quickly struck down as cruel and unusual, it remains on the books, and six additional states have followed California's lead with chemical castration laws of their own.  Moreover, we are currently facing a new wave of legislative efforts to impose chemical or surgical castration as a condition for sex offenders' release from prison.    
The Supreme Court has identified the following questions as being key to a determination of whether a punishment is inherently cruel within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment: (1) Whether it violates the dignity of man, which is the basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment; (2) Whether it violates evolving standards of decency; (3) Whether it involves the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain - that is, pain that completely fails to further either retributive, deterrent, incapacitative or rehabilitative goals; and (4) Whether it involves torture or barbarous methods of punishment, such as drawing and quartering, burning at the stake, or physical castration.       
The Supreme Court has given little guidance as to how these principles are supposed to relate to each other, however, and therefore it is not entirely clear how a court would rule if it had to decide an Eighth Amendment challenge to the chemical castration laws.  Are ""human dignity and contemporary standards of decency"" independent values, or does human dignity simply mean whatever is acceptable by contemporary standards Similarly, are barbarous punishments (such as torture) always unacceptable, or do they only become unacceptable if they completely fail to further any penological goal?  The answer to these questions will determine whether the chemical castration laws ultimately stand or fall.      
The essay that follows will argue that the most effective and appropriate way to determine the relationship between these interpretive principles is to refer them back to the text of the Eighth Amendment, and particularly to the word cruel.  Cruel is generally taken to mean ""indifference to or pleasure in another's distress.""  As this definition indicates, a cruel punishment is not necessarily the same thing as a punishment that fails to further a penological purpose; nor is it necessarily the same thing as a punishment that is not acceptable under current standards of decency.  Rather, the word ""cruel"" implies a certain relationship between the punisher and the person punished: an attitude that the suffering of the offender is either unimportant, or is something to be positively enjoyed.  In other words, a cruel punishment is one that treats the offender as though he or she were not a human person with a claim to our concern as fellow persons, but as a mere animal or thing lacking in basic human dignity.    
Chemical castration is impermissibly cruel in two ways.     First, the very purpose of chemical castration is to exert control over the mind of the offender by rendering it incapable of experiencing sexual desire.  The procedure is sometimes justified on the ground that some sex offenders are pedophiles who experience deviant (and often unwanted) sexual desire for children, and that for this group of offenders, chemical castration is a beneficial form of medical treatment.  This argument fails, however, because the vast majority of sex offenders covered by the chemical castration laws do not have any sexual disorder, much less pedophilia.  Many of these offenders may be incorrigibly bad, dangerous or antisocial people, but they do not suffer from a sexual sickness.  Thus, subjecting them to chemical castration is not even arguably medically appropriate.  Rather, it merely replaces the stone walls and iron bars of a traditional prison (where many sex offenders doubtless belong) with a less expensive but more degrading prison for the mind.    
Second, chemical castration constitutes a profound physical assault on sex offenders.  By pumping massive doses of female hormones into a male body, this procedure subjects offenders to severe physical effects, some of which appear quite likely to have painful, disabling and possibly fatal long-term effects.  To take the most troubling example, long term MPA treatment depletes bone mineral density, so that offenders appear likely to experience osteoporosis and multiple bone fractures as a result of their treatment.  Thus, over the long term, chemical castration will cease to be merely disabling, and may become something more like torture.  The choice of this extraordinarily harmful mode of punishment implies that the health and well-being of sex offenders are simply not important.    
Because chemical castration is designed both to shackle the mind and painfully cripple the body of sex offenders, this essay will argue, it is doubly cruel, and should be struck down as a violation of the Eighth Amendment.

	",34.0,"Critics of tribal sovereignty increasingly point to perceived contradictions between the egalitarian ideals of modern democracies and the citizenship criteria of Indian nations to argue for diminished tribal sovereign immunity and increased federal intervention in Indian affairs. When tribal nations employ citizenship criteria based on Indian ancestry, they may be asked to explain why they are not engaging in immoral, if not unlawful, race-based discrimination. Assertions of tribal sovereignty alone, even when well-founded in the law, do not address how tribes should determine citizenship criteria from within their own norms and values.    
The Cherokee Nation recently faced the challenge of determining its citizenship criteria as they pertain to the descendants of the Cherokee Freedmen. As former slaves of Cherokee citizens, the Freedmen were adopted by the Nation after the Civil War and given full rights of Cherokee citizenship consistent with the terms of a Reconstruction treaty. The incorporation of the Freedmen into the tribe was resisted from the start. When  the Cherokee Nation's highest court affirmed the Freedmen's descendants' citizenship rights in 2006, the Nation called a special election, and on March 3, 2007, voted to approve a constitutional amendment imposing an ""Indian blood"" requirement for citizenship based on the federal Dawes Rolls of the allotment era. If the amendment stands, thousands of African-descended citizens will be eliminated from the tribal registry. In this Article, Professor Ray examines the legal and social history of the Cherokee Freedmen to criticize definitions of Cherokee political identity based on either the Dawes Rolls or notions of ""Indian blood."" Both, he argues, are heteronymous authorities for determining tribal citizenship criteria and should be replaced by the critical hermeneutic of indigenous cultural resources. The wise use of sovereignty, he suggests, requires sustained dialogue between Freedmen's descendants and Cherokees by ""blood,"" not the quick-fix of the political process.

From an employee benefits perspective, consumer driven health care in the broadest sense may refer to limited employer contribution or dual option plans featuring high deductible health coverage with tax advantaged savings vehicles such as Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) and Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) (Daly, 2005).

	",15.0,"Part I of this Article provides an overview of path dependence theory. It outlines the theory and briefly describes three separate strands of the theory: increasing returns path dependence, evolutionary path dependence, and sequencing path dependence, which are rooted in the economics, biological, and rational choice theory literatures, respectively. Although each of these strands has specific and unique characteristics, they are linked by a central insight: In each, an outcome or decision is shaped in specific and systematic ways by the path leading to it.    
Each of these strands of path dependence in turn has important implications for the course and pattern of change in the common law system. Accordingly, Part II applies path dependence theory to the common law. At the core of the common law system is the requirement that courts adhere to the body of principles and rules of action that derive their authority ""solely from usages and customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts recognizing, affirming, and enforcing such usages and customs."" Under the doctrine of stare decisis, higher courts' previous decisions are controlling, courts give their own decisions significant weight, and courts look to non-binding decisions for persuasive precedent. Consequently, although there is some flexibility in the system, precedent remains central to legal deliberation.    
The doctrine of stare decisis thus creates an explicitly path-dependent process. Later decisions rely on, and are constrained by, earlier decisions. More important, the way in which history shapes legal outcomes corresponds to the three-fold division introduced in Part I. Because each legal decision increases the probability that the next will take a particular form, the common law exhibits increasing returns path dependence. Because the law changes through a process of punctuated yet historically constrained evolution, the common law exhibits evolutionary path dependence. And because the legal process involves sequential decisionmaking in a process marked by competing alternatives and multiple actors, the common law exhibits sequencing path dependence. Therefore, just as biological and social processes are constrained by history, the law is firmly guided by the heavy hand of the past.    
Finally, Part III turns from the descriptive to the normative. It analyzes the implications of path dependence theory for the doctrine of stare decisis. Path dependence theory reveals that significant costs may arise out of the reliance on precedent in a common law system. The Article concludes with the claim that, all other things being equal, where the costs of path dependence are expected to be especially significant, courts should consider relaxing the doctrine of stare decisis. This prescription not only supports modifying existing practices of reliance upon precedent, but also provides a theoretical basis for some existing distinctions in the degree that judges rely on certain categories of precedent.

The Special Court for Sierra Leone responded to the victimization of these women by creating a new crime against humanity - the crime of forced marriage - under the statutory category other inhumane acts and issued the first ever indictments for this new crime in April, 2004.  This article seeks to explore the crime of forced marriage from its execution amidst the fighting in Sierra Leone to its place in international criminal law.  In this article, the authors distinguish forced marriage from valid marriage and from other crimes against humanity, establish its viability under both international law and the Statute of the Special Court, and define forced marriage as a unique crime against humanity to be applied in future war crimes trials.

	",,"There is a robust clinical literature on how issues of race and gender may influence all aspects of the clinical setting: the relationship between student and client, the relationship between student and student, the relationship between student and clinical supervisor, the attitude of the fact-finder toward the clinical client. But there has been virtually no attention paid to the role of sanism in the clinical setting.     
Sanism is an  irrational prejudice of the same quality and character as other irrational prejudices that cause and are reflected in prevailing social attitudes of racism, sexism, homophobia and ethnic bigotry. It permeates all aspects of mental disability law, and affects all participants in the mental disability law system: fact finders, counsel, expert and lay witnesses.  Its corrosive effects have warped mental disability law jurisprudence in involuntary civil commitment law, in institutional law, in tort law, and in all aspects of the criminal trial process.    
Sanist myths exert especially great power over lawyers who represent persons with mental disabilities. The use of stereotypes, typification, and deindividualization inevitably means that sanist lawyers will trivialize both their clients' problems and the importance of any eventual solution to these problems. Sanist lawyers implicitly and explicitly question their clients' competence and credibility, a move that significantly impairs their advocacy efforts.    
These phenomena are especially troubling in the clinical setting, in which students are exposed for the first time to the skills that go to the heart of the lawyering process: interviewing, investigating, counseling and negotiating. All of these are difficult for us (and our students) to learn, but this difficulty is significantly increased when the client is a person with mental disability (or one so perceived). The difficulties can be further exacerbated when the clinical teacher - either overtly or covertly - expresses sanist thoughts or reifies sanist myths. And sanism problems continue at every ""critical moment"" of the clinical experience: the initial interview, case preparation, case conferences, planning litigation (or negotiation) strategy, trial preparation, trial and appeal.    
This paper will explore (1) the meaning of sanism, (2) the general impact of sanism on the representation of persons with mental disabilities, (3) the special problems faced when sanism infects the clinical teaching process, and (4) some tentative solutions to this dilemma.

The U.K. has the same array of institutional investors as the U.S., much looser regulation of these investors, and a strong securities market (much like the U.S.). On the whole, British institutional investors are moderately more active than their U.S. counterparts. They intervene in companies to change management a few times per year. But they are still often passive, absent a crisis, and often prefer to sell their shares rather than press for a change in management or company strategy. Non-legal considerations, including fear that their activism may benefit their institutional rivals, inhibit their desire to participate in corporate governance. If Japan and Germany show how American corporate governance might have developed differently under different legal rules, Britain shows how American corporate governance might look rather similar under more limited regulation.

	",,"For the past four decades, Anglo-American legal philosophy has been preoccupied - some might say obsessed - with something called the ""Hart-Dworkin"" debate.  Since the appearance in 1967 of ""The Model of Rules I,"" Ronald Dworkin's seminal critique of H.L.A. Hart's theory of legal positivism, countless books and articles have been written either defending Hart against Dworkin's objections or defending Dworkin against Hart's defenders.  My purpose in this essay is not to declare an ultimate victor; rather it is to identify precisely the core issue around which the debate is organized.  Is the Hart-Dworkin debate, for example, about whether the law contains principles, as well as rules?  Or does it concern whether judges have discretion in hard cases?  Is it about the proper way to interpret legal texts in the American legal system?  Or is it about the very possibility of conceptual jurisprudence?  
Although trying to capture the essence of a philosophical debate can be tricky, I think that there is an important unity to the Hart-Dworkin debate that can be described in a relatively straightforward manner.  I suggest that the debate is organized around one of the most profound issues in the philosophy of law, namely, the relation between legality and morality.  Dworkin's basic strategy throughout the course of the debate has been to argue that, in one form or another, legality is ultimately determined not by social facts alone, but by moral facts as well.  This contention directly challenges, and threatens to undermine, the positivist picture about the nature of law, in which legality is never determined by morality, but solely by social practice.  As one might expect, the response by Hart and his followers has been to argue that this dependence of legality on morality is either merely apparent or does not, in fact, undermine the social foundations of law.    
The Hart-Dworkin debate, I also try to show, is not a monolithic entity.  In the second half of the paper, I describe how Dworkin modified his critique to circumvent the responses of Hart's followers, thereby inaugurating a new phase in the debate.  Virtually no attention, however, has been paid to this latter challenge, which is especially surprising given that none of the previous positivistic defenses are helpful against it.  I then sketch out a possible response positivists might offer to this extremely powerful objection.

We find that computerization makes a contribution to measured productivity and output growth in the short term (using one year differences) that is consistent with normal returns to computer investments. However, the productivity and output contributions associated with computerization are up to five times greater over long periods (using five to seven year differences). The results suggest that the observed contribution of computerization is accompanied by relatively large and time-consuming investments in complementary inputs, such as organizational capital, that may be omitted in conventional calculations of productivity. The large long-run contribution of computers and their associated complements that we uncover may partially explain the subsequent investment surge in computers in the late 1990s.

This form of American exceptionalism reflects both higher rates of divorce and higher rates of breakup among cohabiting couples in the US. The increase in divorce, which began in the early 1960s but leveled off in the early 1980s, affected women at all educational levels. The increase in nonmarital childbearing, which was concentrated between the early 1960s and early 1990s, mainly affected non-white women and white women without college degrees. These changes appear to be a product of changes in sexual mores, which reduced the role of sexual attraction and increased the importance of economic calculations in decisions about whether to marry. The increased importance of economic factors coincided with a decline in non-college men's ability to support a family and perhaps also with an increase in conflict over men and women's roles.

Chief among these is how much to save for retirement and how to invest those savings. The paper suggests ways that advances in the theory of finance combined with innovations in financial contracting technology might be used to improve social welfare by designing and producing a new generation of user-friendly life-cycle products for consumers. It contrasts the old Markowitz single-period paradigm of efficient diversification with a new Mertonian paradigm that takes account of multi-period hedging, labor supply flexibility, and habit formation.

	",173.0,"The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence on the profitability of technical analysis. The empirical literature is categorized into two groups, early and modern studies, according to the characteristics of testing procedures. Early studies indicate that technical trading strategies are profitable in foreign exchange markets and futures markets, but not in stock markets. Modern studies indicate that technical trading strategies consistently generate economic profits in a variety of speculative markets at least until the early 1990s. Among a total of 95 modern studies, 56 studies find positive results regarding technical trading strategies, 20 studies obtain negative results, and 19 studies indicate mixed results. Despite the positive evidence on the profitability of technical trading strategies, most empirical studies are subject to various problems in their testing procedures, e.g. data snooping, ex post selection of trading rules or search technologies, and difficulties in estimation of risk and transaction costs. Future research must address these deficiencies in testing in order to provide conclusive evidence on the profitability of technical trading strategies.

	",26.0,Scientific-funding bodies are increasingly under pressure to use journal rankings to measure research quality. Hiring and promotion committees routinely hear an equivalent argument: 'this is important work because it is to be published in prestigious journal X'. But how persuasive is such an argument? This paper examines data on citations to articles published 25 years ago. It finds that it is better to write the best article published in an issue of a medium-quality journal such as the OBES than all four of the worst four articles published in an issue of an elite journal like the AER.

Affinity fraud differs from other forms of securities fraud because perpetrators establish their credibility and the credibility of their investment schemes by appealing to the trust that group members share, often promising that some of the invested funds will be used to assist the group's church or ethnic community.  This reliance on group trust and sense of community persuades otherwise cautious people to participate in these fraudulent investment schemes.  These schemes fleece people out of millions of dollars and have drawn the concern of state regulators around the country, causing such regulators to rank it among the top five most problematic securities schemes.  This Article argues that the fact that these securities schemes prey on people's charitable impulses and sense of group trust justifies enhancing the punishment of those who commit affinity fraud.

	",76.0,"The Studebaker-Packard Corporation occupies a distinctive place in the lore of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. No single event is more closely associated with ERISA than the shutdown of the Studebaker plant in South Bend, Indiana. Soon after the plant closed in December 1963, Studebaker terminated the retirement plan for hourly workers, and the plan defaulted on its obligations. The plight of Studebaker employees quickly emerged as a symbol of the need for pension reform. This article examines the history of the Studebaker-Packard Corporation to understand why and how the shutdown came to play a role in the political history of ERISA. Briefly, the shutdown played an important role in pension reform because the United Auto Workers union was prepared to take advantage of the political opportunity the shutdown created. By the time the plant closed, the UAW was well aware that ""default risk"" - the risk that a pension plan will terminate without enough funds to meet its obligations - threatened union members. Studebaker-Packard had terminated the retirement plan for employees of the former Packard Motor Car Company in 1958. Packard workers got even less than their counterparts at Studebaker would receive in 1964. The Packard termination convinced UAW president Walter Reuther that the union needed to protect its members from default risk. In the early 1960s, the UAW devised a remedy - a proposal for ""pension reinsurance"" - that is a precursor of the termination-insurance program created by Title IV of ERISA. The Studebaker shutdown gave the union an opportunity to move default risk and termination insurance onto the legislative agenda. The success of this effort in agenda-setting indelibly linked Studebaker to the cause of pension reform.

	",16.0,"In the last decade of the twentieth century, every state adopted a new criminal offender community notification law. While critics challenged these provisions on a number of grounds, one potential consequential cost of these laws received no attention: the possibility that they might disparately impose their significant burdens on racial minorities and, particularly, African-Americans. This article breaks this silence about race and Megan's Laws, establishing that community notification provisions do have a significantly disparate racial impact. Using newly gathered statistical data, across multiple jurisdictions, it shows that African-Americans are over-represented on these public registries of criminals. It considers how the contours of these provisions may promote this result, and also explores why this disparity is consequential.    
Moving from an empirical study of these provisions, the article then investigates the reasons why race concerns never surfaced in the community notification debates. Given the centrality of racial critiques in the criminal law literature, one might have expected legislators, advocates, or at least scholars to have investigated this issue previously. The article suggests several reasons for this remarkable silence, including the narrow scope of equal protection doctrine, failures of legislatures to demand transparency about race, social phenomena such as moral panics and availability cascades, and the framing of Megan's Laws as an answer to white-on-white crime. It then offers suggestions for doctrinal, legislative, and scholarly moves that increase the transparency of race issues, exposing them to fuller democratic debate.

Research into this phenomenon has so far focused on how the major tasks of software development are organized and motivated. But a complete user system requires the execution of ""mundane but necessary"" tasks as well. In this paper, we explore how the mundane but necessary task of field support for open source Apache server software is organized, and how and why users are motivated to participate in providing it. We find that the present system works well and that information providers are largely rewarded by benefits directly received from a related task. We also find, however, that the present help system is by and for only a few - and that changes would be needed if and as volume increases. General lessons for user-based innovation systems includes the clear willingness of users to openly reveal their proprietary information. This bodes well for the efficiency of user-only innovation systems. Open revealing is rational behavior if the information has low competitive value and/or if information providers think that other users know the same thing they do, and would reveal the information if they did not.

We tabulate critical values that enable using the first-stage F-statistic (or, when there are multiple endogenous regressors, the Cragg-Donald (1993) statistic) to test whether given instruments are weak.

	",,"Taxpayers remit through withholding and estimated tax payments substantially more than the amounts assessed upon filing of returns. Some excess payments may reflect involuntary institutional features (e.g., default withholding rules), but there may also be voluntary excess remittances reflecting taxpayer preferences. Our study uses a case-based experiment administered to 162 work-experienced MBA student volunteers to investigate such preferences in an environment stripped of transaction costs and sources of confusion regarding minimum payment provisions. In addition, we use a factorial design to explore the sensitivity of taxpayer interim payment preferences to tax policy considerations involving uncertainty, payment form, and experience.     
We present three related arguments for why taxpayers might prefer interim payment patterns that violate strict adherence to the time value of money. First, if taxpayers adopt a reference point of covering the end-of-year tax bill with their interim payments, the alternative of delaying payment in order to receive a larger sum now may be perceived as an unattractive prospect (Shelley 1993; Loewenstein 1988). Second, the dread phenomenon may explain why people often express preferences to get a negative outcome over with rather than anticipate its future occurrence (Loewenstein and Thaler 1992; Loewenstein 1987). Finally, taxpayers may view excess interim payments as a form of forced savings, anticipating their limited self-control (Shefrin and Thaler 1992; Thaler and Shefrin 1981; Schelling 1984). All three arguments offer consistent predictions in our setting, offering theoretical reasons why policy makers should consider taxpayers' preferences when formulating policies involving interim tax remittances.    
The experiment involved asking participants to indicate desired quarterly tax remittances for a hypothetical case in which a taxpayer expected $16,000 of tax on an annual income of $80,000. We manipulated the uncertainty associated with the end-of-year tax liability by adding a description of the annual tax liability in a worst-case scenario. The form of payment was either withholding from wages or estimated tax installments. We also assessed the effects of self-reported taxpaying experience on taxpayer preferences. In all treatment conditions, case information indicated a minimum quarterly payment that would avoid any underpayment penalty (based on the prior-year tax liability). Participants basing decisions strictly on the time value of money would prefer to remit only this minimum amount in each of our treatment conditions.    
We find that 43 percent of the participants indicate a preference to pay more tax on an interim basis than the minimum necessary to avoid an underpayment penalty. Because participants are screened for case comprehension, we interpret this frequency as reflecting genuine preferences, not ignorance or confusion. We also find that participants' overpayment preferences are significantly more pronounced in cases where the current-year tax liability is more uncertain. This effect is different from risk aversion, because even the most risk averse taxpayer would be better off economically by paying the minimum possible to the government and investing any desired provision for taxes in a risk-free account. In contrast to the effect of uncertainty, we find that preferences for overpayment are robust to whether the payment form is withholding from wages or estimated tax installments. Finally, we find that taxpayer experience mitigates the general propensity to overpay and also mutes the influence of uncertainty.

	",86.0,"A conflict of interest exists when a party to a transaction could potentially make a gain from taking actions that are detrimental to the other party in the transaction. This paper examines the economics of conflicts of interest in financial institutions and reviews the growing empirical literature (mostly focused on analysts) on the economic implications of these conflicts. Economic analysis shows that, although conflicts of interest are omnipresent when contracting is costly and parties are imperfectly informed, there are important factors that mitigate their impact and, strikingly, it is possible for customers of financial institutions to benefit from the existence of such conflicts. The empirical literature reaches conclusions that differ across types of conflicts of interest, but overall these conclusions are more ambivalent and certainly more benign than the conclusions drawn by journalists and politicians from mostly anecdotal evidence. Though much has been made of conflicts of interest arising from investment banking activities, there is no consensus in the empirical literature supporting the view that conflicts resulting from these activities had a systematic adverse impact on customers of financial institutions.

	",,"While most countries are committed to increasing access to safe water and thereby reducing child mortality, there is little consensus on how to actually improve water services. One important proposal under discussion is whether to privatize water provision. In the 1990s Argentina embarked on one of the largest privatization campaigns in the world, including the privatization of local water companies covering approximately 30 percent of the country's municipalities. Using the variation in ownership of water provision across time and space generated by the privatization process, we find that child mortality fell 8 percent in the areas that privatized their water services and that the effect was largest (26 percent) in the poorest areas. We check the robustness of these estimates using cause-specific mortality. While privatization is associated with significant reductions in deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases, it is uncorrelated with deaths from causes unrelated to water conditions.

	",,"This paper, which is still in a very early form, looks again at the recurring problem of Christmas and the Constitution.  Conventional Establishment Clause analysis of Christmas is built on three propositions:  First, Christmas is in a sense two holidays: a Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus, and a secular winter holiday.  Creches and the like are symbols of the religious Christmas, while trees and Santa Claus are among the trappings of the secular Christmas.  Second, government participation in celebrating the secular Christmas is unproblematic.  Third, celebrating the religious side of Christmas does risk violating the Constitution, but embedding the religious element in a secular context can mitigate the infirmity.   
Much of the criticism of current doctrine has honed in on the third of these propositions.  I want to focus, however, on the premise of a ""secular"" Christmas on which the first two propositions of the doctrine are built.  My argument is that the notion of a secular Christmas, and the assertion that the tree and Santa and so on are secular symbols of that secular Christmas, are both deeply problematic.  More specifically, I argue that Santa and the like play a complex, rich, and tension-filled role in the ""religious economy"" of Christmas, and that we cannot begin to tackle the constitutional problem of Christmas until we unravel that complexity.  Santa and the tree, even if they carry little or no propositional content, are ""religious capital"" - ""cultural accessories"" to the religious meaning of Christmas.  And, paradoxically, they can also, under certain circumstances, take on downright anti-religious meaning.  When the government adopts these objects and symbols and practices for itself, the effect is religiously and constitutionally complex.  The solution to these problems, however, is itself neither obvious nor straightforward.

	",,"The disciplinary rules of every state prohibit attorneys from charging unreasonable fees. However, these provisions are virtually never enforced based on the size of the fee alone; almost all cases involve independent forms of misconduct, such as falsifying billing records, or demanding fees in excess of an agreed upon amount. The only two cases the authors could find in which attorneys have been disciplined solely based on the size of the fee involved blue-chip civil attorneys - former Harvard and Yale law school faculty members - who represented working-class defendants in criminal matters. In both cases, the conclusion that the fee was excessive was questionable; the clients were completely exonerated of criminal charges and the amounts involved would have been unexceptional in elite civil practice. These disciplinary prosecutions were particularly doubtful, the authors argue, because the Sixth Amendment right to retain counsel of choice prohibits the government from limiting the amount of money criminal defendants can pay their lawyers.     
The reasonable fee rules are either unenforced or perversely enforced because they are not designed to limit lawyer's fees or incomes per se, but to ensure that lawyers do not take advantage of clients, and that clients understand the nature of the legal services they are buying. The mismatch between the purpose of the rules and their language should be remedied by making clear that lawyers are obligated to talk with their clients about their legal options and offer some estimate of what they might cost. But fees negotiated after appropriate disclosure should not subject an attorney to discipline.

	",28.0,"This paper uses various decomposition techniques to understand the nature of household inequality in contemporary South Africa. It examines, firstly, the importance of race in overall inequality; secondly, the contribution of major income sources to national inequality; and thirdly, the relationship between inequality, poverty and the labour market. Within-race inequality is also high with intra-African inequality being highest. The paper also shows the importance of differential access to wage income in driving household income inequality in South Africa.     
Gauteng, South Africa's economic powerhouse, has long been dependent on immigration to supply its labour requirements, a phenomenon deeply rooted in the provinces early economic history and the development of mining and heavy industry. South African immigrants to the province (or in-migrants) were defined in one of two ways: individuals who were born in South Africa, but outside of Gauteng, or individuals whose most recent move in the 1996-2001 period was to Gauteng from one of the other eight provinces. In-migrants are described in terms of their demographics and educational and employment status. Further, in-migrants access to public services including electricity and water and other indicators of their living standards, such as housing, were analysed. As far as possible, the analysis compared in-migrants to non-migrants and intra-Gauteng migrants in order to provide insight into special benefits or challenges that in-migrant households may present. The Labour Force Survey module on migrant labour allowed the profiling of migrant labourers and the approximation of economic links between Gauteng and other provinces as represented by remittances.    
The study found that a large proportion of Gauteng residents were born outside the province, or moved into the province in the inter-census period, indicating a relatively mobile population.

Rather, the naturally layered nature of the internet leads to overlapping rights of exclusion that cause underuse of internet resources: a tragedy of the anticommons. And finally, the article shows that the common law of property can act to limit the costs of this internet anticommons.

	",18.0,"Previous studies have argued that longer civil wars have been caused by ethnically polarized societies, since rebel cohesion is easier and more lasting with polarization. This study shows that external interventions tend to reduce the cost of coordinating a rebellion (or of fighting a rebellion), thereby lengthening the duration of civil wars even in societies that are not ethnically polarized.    
Elbadawi and Sambanis combine an empirical model of external intervention with a theoretical model of civil war duration. Their empirical model of intervention allows them to analyze civil war duration using expected rather than actual external intervention as an explanatory variable in the duration model.    
Unlike previous studies, they find that external intervention is positively associated with the duration of civil war.    
They distinguish partial third-party interventions that extend the length of war from multilateral peace operations, which have a mandate to restore peace without taking sides - and which typically take place at war's end, or at least when both sides have agreed to a cease-fire.    
In a future paper the authors will examine whether partial third-party interventions - whatever their effect on a war's duration - increase the risk of war's recurrence. If that proves true, then even if interventions reduce the length of civil war they may do so at the cost of further destabilizing the political system and sowing the seeds of future rebellion.    
This paper - a product of Public Economics, Development Research Group - is part of a larger effort in the group to study the economics of civil wars, crime, and violence. The study was funded by the Bank's Research Support Budget under the research project The Economics of Political and Criminal Violence (RPO 682-99).

Three primary streams of enquiry can be identified within the strategic and behavioural literature, which focus on the issues of strategic fit, organizational fit and the acquisition process itself. The recent achievements within each of these research streams are briefly reviewed. However, in parallel to these research advances, the failure rates of mergers and acquisitions have remained consistently high. Possible reasons for this dichotomy are discussed, which in turn highlight the significant opportunities that remain for future M&A research.

	",114.0,"Northeast Utilities System, an electricity generating and distribution company in Southern New England, adopted the low-cost dominant strategy fashionable in the management consulting companies in the mid-1980s and carried through with that strategy in the face of extreme employee, regulatory, and public resistance to the mid-1990s.  Management achieved a significant measure of its strategic cost-cutting goals in that decade, but simultaneously took on ever-increasing risk that its operation of three large nuclear power plants subject to that cost cutting would be declared unsafe by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Management's strategy was not constrained by the company board of directors, even though nuclear shutdown could destroy the market value of the shares of the investors.  The ""worst case"" scenario finally did take place, when the Millstone plants in 1996 were not allowed to operate until rebuilt and then relicensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Subsequent to this rejection of strategy by the regulator, the Northeast generation facilities were broken up and auctioned off, and the distribution facilities were put on the market.    
Is this disaster just another in the long line of corporate failures?  Our response is that the Northeast experience is different, and raises a basic question worth a detailed answer.  The application of competitive strategy by Northeast Utilities management, even when faced with increasing risk of nuclear plant shutdown, increased in intensity and scope.  Why did management in effect ignore the risk involved?  The narrative of events supports the explanation that it was in management's interest to do exactly that particularly after 1992 and before 1996.  The narrative also supports the argument that it was not in the investor's interest, and, contrary to the charter of the corporation, the investor's interests as represented by the board were not controlling when it came to the application of strategy by management.  Management's implementation of strategy may not have deliberately destroyed the company, but its implementation took on the significant and apparent risk that the result would be the destruction of the enterprise.  The implications for management, even in the worst-case result, were orthogonal to those of the board and the owners.    
This competitive strategy was, for the most part, an application of generic low-cost-dominant positioning methodology.  The application was in a corporation dominated by management, where downside risk would affect the shareholders, consumers, and the public, but least of all management.  The ""worst case"" result was not certain, but could be tolerated by management, if not by the company's owners.  The return-risk profile examined here would not seem to be unique to Northeast Utilities.

Rather, the Fed reacts to the very ""real"" signal sent by unemployment, in a way that suggests that a baseless fear of full employment is a principal force behind monetary policy. Tests of variations in the workings of a Taylor Rule, using dummy variable regressions, on data going back to 1969 suggest that after 1983 the Federal Reserve largely ceased reacting to inflation or high unemployment, but continued to react when unemployment fell ""too low."" Further, we find that monetary policy (measured by the yield curve) has significant causal impact on pay inequality - a domain where the Fed refuses responsibility. Finally, we test whether Federal Reserve policy has exhibited a pattern of partisan bias in presidential election years, with results that suggest the presence of such bias, after controlling for the effects of inflation and unemployment.

	",18.0,"Previous studies have demonstrated that, in a number of contexts, federal appeals court judges divide along ideological lines when deciding cases upon the merits. To date, however, researchers have failed to find evidence that circuit judges take advantage of selective publication rules to further their ideological preferences - for example, by voting more ideologically in published cases that have precedential effect than in unpublished cases that lack binding effect upon future panels. This article evaluates the possibility that judges engage in strategic judicial lawmaking by voting more ideologically in published cases than in unpublished cases. To test this hypothesis, all asylum cases decided by the Ninth Circuit over a ten-year period were coded for analysis, and Markov Chain-Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the extent to which publication increased the likelihood that each judge in the data set would vote in favor of asylum. A number of Democratic appointees proved significantly more likely to vote in favor of asylum in published cases. No such pattern emerged with respect to Republican appointees. This study also confirms earlier findings that Democratic and Republican appointees divide along ideological lines to a significant extent in both published and unpublished cases. The extent of the ideological voting behavior observed in unpublished cases calls into question the validity of much research on judicial behavior, insofar as such research continues to rely exclusively upon the analysis of published opinions and ignores unpublished opinions for reasons of convenience.

	",,"Since 1985, in jurisdictions all over the United States, fathers have been awarded sole custody of their children based on claims that mothers alienated these children due to a pathological medical syndrome called Parental Alienation Syndrome (""PAS""). Given that some such cases have involved stark outcomes, including murder and suicide, PAS's admissibility in U.S. courts deserves scrutiny.    
This article presents the first comprehensive analysis of the science, law, and policy issues involved in PAS's evidentiary admissibility. As a novel scientific theory, PAS's admissibility is governed by a variety of evidentiary gatekeeping standards that seek to protect legal fora from the influence of pseudo-science. This article analyzes every precedent-bearing decision and law review article referencing PAS in the past twenty years, finding that precedent holds PAS inadmissible and the majority of legal scholarship views it negatively. The article further analyzes PAS's admissibility under the standards defined in Frye v. United States, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Kumho Tire Company v. Carmichael, and Rules 702 and 704(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, including analysis of PAS's scientific validity and reliability; concluding that PAS remains an ipse dixit and inadmissible under these standards. The article also analyzes the writings of PAS's originator, child psychiatrist Richard Gardner - including twenty-three peer-reviewed articles and fifty legal decisions he cited in support of his claim that PAS is scientifically valid and legally admissible - finding that these materials support neither PAS's existence, nor its legal admissibility. Finally, the article examines the policy issues raised by PAS's admissibility through an analysis of PAS's roots in Gardner's theory of human sexuality, a theory that views adult-child sexual contact as benign and beneficial to the reproduction of the species.    
The article concludes that science, law, and policy all support PAS's present and future inadmissibility.

	",11.0,"We present a framework for modeling and estimating dynamics of variance and skewness from time-series data using a maximum likelihood approach assuming that the errors from the mean have a non-central conditional t distribution. We parameterize conditional variance and conditional skewness in an autoregressive framework similar to that of GARCH models and  estimate the parameters in a conditional noncentral t distribution. The likelihood function has two time-varying parameters, the degrees of freedom and the noncentrality parameter. We apply this methodology to daily and monthly equity returns data from the U.S., Germany and Japan, concurrently estimating conditional mean, variance and skewness. We find that there is significant conditional skewness.     
We then use this model to understand how the inclusion of conditional skewness affects some of the well-known stylized facts about conditional variance and the relation between returns and conditional variance. Two important stylized facts about conditional variance we examine are persistence and asymmetry in variance. Persistence refers to the tendency where high conditional variance is followed by high conditional variance. Asymmetry in variance, i.e., the observation that conditional variance depends on the sign of the innovation to the conditional mean has been documented in asymmetric variance models used in Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1993) and Engle and Ng (1993). We find that the evidence of asymmetric variance is really just conditional skewness. Inclusion of conditional skewness also impacts the persistence in conditional variance.

	",23.0,"In several key industries, including semiconductors, biotechnology, computer software, and the Internet, our patent system is creating a patent thicket: an overlapping set of patent rights requiring that those seeking to commercialize new technology obtain licenses from multiple patentees. The patent thicket is especially thorny when combined with the risk of hold-up, namely the danger that new products will inadvertently infringe on patents issued after these products were designed. The need to navigate the patent thicket and hold-up is especially pronounced in industries such as telecommunications and computing in which formal standard-setting is a core part of bringing new technologies to market. Cross-licenses and patent pools are two natural and effective methods used by market participants to cut through the patent thicket, but each involves some transaction costs. Antitrust law and enforcement, with its historical hostility to cooperation among horizontal rivals, can easily add to these transaction costs. Yet a few relatively simple principles, such as the desirability package licensing for complementary patents but not for substitute patents, can go a long way towards insuring that antitrust will help solve the problems caused by the patent thicket and by hold-up rather than exacerbating them.

	",38.0,"In this paper, we examine the economic impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) by analyzing foreign listing behavior onto U.S. and U.K. stock exchanges before and after the enactment of the Act in 2002.  Using a sample of all listing events onto U.S. and U.K. exchanges from 1995-2006, we develop an exchange choice model that captures firm-level, industry-level, exchange-level and country-level listing incentives, and test whether these listing preferences changed following the enactment of the Act.  After controlling for firm characteristics and other economic determinants of these firms' exchange choice, we find that the listing preferences of large foreign firms choosing between U.S. exchanges and the LSE's Main Market did not change following the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley.  In contrast, we find that the likelihood of a U.S. listing among small foreign firms choosing between the Nasdaq and LSE's Alternative Investment Market decreased following the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley.  The negative effect among small firms is consistent with these marginal companies being less able to absorb the incremental costs associated with SOX compliance. The screening of smaller firms with weaker governance attributes from U.S. exchanges is consistent with the heightened governance costs imposed by the Act increasing the bonding-related benefits of a U.S. listing.

	",,"Congress responded in similar ways to 2001's major national crises: bolstering internal controls in corporate America under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in response to Enron's debacle and imposing internal controls on its financial services industry under the USA PATRIOT Act in response to 9/11's terrorism.  These reflexive legislative responses to national crisis fit a pattern of proliferating controls as a first-order policy option dating to the mid-1970s. Documenting this proliferation and untangling the definition of internal controls, this Article attributes the appeal of internal controls as a policy option to systemic forces including the movements for deregulation and cooperative compliance, resistance to overt federal preemption of state corporate law, the monitoring model of the board of directors in corporate governance and audit committee ascendance, the social responsibility movement and the diversification of auditing services. Manifest appeals include the limited substantive content control directives carry and the increasing harmonization of control types around audit committees, compliance officers, employee training manuals and external audits of controls fitting neatly into the team production theory of corporate practice and law and making even mandatory controls appealing to corporations being implicitly regulated.    
Illuminating the limits of this policy option is an examination of comparative attitudes towards control risk shown by the auditing and legal professions. Audit approaches control risk with a formal context, definition and measurement apparatus consciously aware of risk's inevitability and that controls may increase or decrease risk. Yet auditors advertise their product as capable of doing more. Legal culture takes the advertisements seriously. The resulting expectations gap can be reinforced when audit's emphasis on systems and controls creates false impressions that these reflect likely achievement of underlying objectives. Proliferation of internal controls in the face of crisis shows social anxieties. Assuaging social anxieties with these tools can create illusions of control and denial of risk.  Legal culture is telling managers to take steps to buy absolute control; audit culture is happy to sell it; the truth is, there is no absolute control. No system provides absolute assurance. The gap is significant between (1) what systems can deliver versus (2) what legal culture expects and what auditors advertise they can deliver.    
When internal controls fail, the policy response is to require audits of controls. This is the story of Sarbanes-Oxley. In the 1970s, the SEC persuaded Congress in response to crisis to pass the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act requiring companies to have internal financial controls. In the early 2000s, in response to crisis perceived to originate in internal control failure, the SEC persuaded Congress to pass Sarbanes-Oxley requiring auditors to audit those internal controls. In this cycle of control mandates followed by audit mandates, pressure builds on audit to create controls that can be audited. But since controls do not automatically reduce audit risk and may increase it, audits of them cannot speak to the effectiveness of underlying substance over which controls offer no reliable assurance. Legislative enthusiasm for controls as crisis-response mechanisms pretends controls can do more than they can and when controls consequently proliferate they can do even less - it becomes hard to assess which controls are effective.      
Control proliferation and generality complicate foreseeability analysis in tort. If controls applied only in particular settings with defined functions, they could indicate that related risk realization was foreseeable. They might be useful in assessing difficult pragmatic questions of causation when losses arise after controls fail. But when every aspect of corporate affairs is layered with elaborate controls there is no credible basis for drawing such inferences. Control signifies nothing special, so offers no insight concerning foreseeability or causation. This has not, however, prevented using control failures in exactly this mistaken way. When controls fail, the existence of control norms, directives, or practices are relevant to evaluating the standard of care exercised and matters of causation and foreseeability with little or no regard to the particular control at issue or its underlying substantive purpose.      
But Sarbanes-Oxley and PATRIOT show two polar extremes of control types: internal controls over financial reporting and controls dedicated to fighting terrorism. Two competing models of regulatory theory map onto this range. The deterrence model hypothesizes that target decision-making is conducted by comparing the cost of compliance with the product of enforcement threats and penalty levels. The cooperation model enlarges the framework by recognizing norms of compliance that may be skewed by the simple adjustment of threat and penalty levels. For internal controls the relative purchase of these models varies with the tenor of the control: financial controls link to the deterrence model where penalties for failure should be high and liability likely; externally-oriented controls are congruent with the cooperation model: penalties and liability risk should be zero. This theoretical account of the distinction between control types is consistent with the longer history of corporate law but the current legal environment's ambitions for internal controls threatens to upset this traditional stance. This appears most acute in the case of terrorism and provides an internal-controls-based defense of general compensation schemes such as the 9/11 Victims' Compensation Fund.

	",8.0,"Since the middle of the last century, the ideal of constitutional legitimacy has been grounded on the foundation of the concept of the rule of law. The rule of law is usually understood in two senses: first, as embracing firm limits on an arbitrary use of power, that is, of the use of the state power when not grounded in law (process aspect); and second, as vesting the state with a critical role as guardian of a set of foundational communally embraced substantive norms that are to be protected and furthered through the use of state power grounded in law (substantive aspect). The Chinese Constitution of 1982 has, as a formal matter, embraced the idea of the rule of law in its process aspect. The Preamble declares that the Constitution is the fundamental law of the state and has supreme legal authority and Article 5 as amended in 1999 emphasizes the People's Republic of China practices ruling the country in accordance with the law and building a socialist country of law.     
However, it is more difficult to discern even a formal adoption of the rule of law in its substantive aspect. As a consequence, outsiders have questioned the fidelity of the Chinese state to the rule of law because of the control by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of the apparatus of law making in China. In one sense these arguments can be reduced to a criticism of Chinese constitutionalism as illegitimate because it lacks a basis in moral and ethical norms outside of the personal desires of the leaders of the CCP.     
This paper suggests that traditional criticism misperceives the fundamental nature of Chinese Constitutionalism as it attempts to fashion its own distinct socialist rule of law constitutionalism. Fundamental to this socialist rule of law is the core premise the connection between the apparatus of the state (its institutions) and that of the Chinese Communist Party (as the Party in power). The paper examines the way the normative basis of this socialist rule of law has been advanced through the use of increasingly sophisticated and complex specific ideological frameworks into the constitution. This may suggest a greater willingness to advance the implementation of ideology, and the substantive structure it represents, through state power grounded in law. However, because the norm structures of Chinese ideology articulated through the CCP remain either alien or antithetical to their usual Western counterparts, they remain opaque outside of China.     
To examine the parameters of this possible shift in Chinese constitutionalism, the paper will examine one element in this process of incorporation - the inclusion of sange daibiao (the 'Three Represents') into the governance structures of the CCP after 2000 and the Chinese Constitution after 2004. Like the earlier constitutional assimilation of Deng Xiaoping Theory, the adoption of sange daibiao may serve, at least as a formal matter, to further incorporate substantive rule of law elements into Chinese constitutionalism. Sange daibiao illustrates the way in which China is seeking to construct socialist rule of law through a commitment to an institutional structure of the state in which the CCP serves not as a mere Western style political party but as an integral organ of state power. The focus is on the reality of the CCP within the state. Sange Daibiao provides an ideological basis, a deep constitutional foundation, for the position of the CCP at the center of the constitutional apparatus of the Chinese state. But it does more than that - it also provides the basis through which the rule of law, as a framework for the proper relationship between state institutions (representing the collective) and the individual (as an instrument of that collective). As developed by the organs of the CCP, it is clear that Sange Daibiao can provide the principles through which the framework of commonly understood rule of law constitutionalism can be adopted with Chinese characteristics.

	",13.0,"Each year the federal individual income tax delivers over $500 billion worth of incentives intended to encourage socially beneficial activities. Despite their efficiency rationale and substantial price tag, relatively little attention has been paid to the question of what is the most efficient form for these tax incentives. Currently the vast majority operate through deductions or exclusions, which link the size of the tax benefit to the taxpayer's marginal tax bracket. This Article argues that uniform refundable credits are a more efficient approach for tax incentives intended to correct for positive externalities, absent evidence that externalities or elasticities associated with the subsidized activity vary by income class. This conclusion holds even if no positive externalities are present. Moreover, even when evidence of differences in externalities or elasticities does exist, the most efficient subsidy is almost certainly still some type of refundable credit. The efficiency benefits of refundable credits are further magnified by their tendency to automatically smooth household income and macroeconomic demand. This Article therefore proposes a dramatic change in how the government should provide tax incentives for socially valued activities: the default for all such tax incentives should be a uniform refundable tax credit.    
This Article also considers the arguments of refundable credit opponents. It concludes that concerns based on administrative and compliance costs are generally overstated. In addition, it finds that the vast majority of those who benefit from current-law refundable credits have positive income tax liability over time. Refundable credits are thus frequently the rough justice equivalent of allowing carryovers and carrybacks, which are common in other parts of the tax code. The Article therefore argues that the objection that tax incentives should not be structured as refundable credits because all Americans should pay some income tax is not only conceptually problematic; it is generally empirically unpersuasive on its own terms.

	",,"This paper confirms that high earnings yield portend high equity returns. Absolute valuation levels of equity have predictive power over future long run equity returns. The predictability is far less powerful in the short term. On a tactical investment horizon, investors tend to rely on the relative valuation of equity versus bonds to gauge whether equity markets are attractive. The FED model, which compares earnings yield and bond yield, is the preferred yardstick in the finance profession. First, this paper examines the FED model and shows that it is not only theoretically flawed, but it is also not able to predict equity returns over long sample periods. Second, we improve the model by adding corrections for perceived risk enabling a better fit of the data. Third, the main innovation is testing a tactical asset allocation model constructed on the basis of the improved FED model. A model portfolio taking advantage of the short-term deviation in relative value, corrected for risk, leads to superior performance.

What's important is whether this is an activity that law schools ought to encourage their faculty to engage in.  Because it facilitates what I call the public intellectual model of the legal scholar, I tend to favor blogging. For a long time many legal scholars have been writing mainly for each other about ideas whose bearing on the issues of the day is tenuous at best. Scholarship that has no audience outside those who produce is more often than not bad scholarship.  There is a need for someone in the legal academy to write about contemporary legal issues in a style that is accessible to the general public (or at least to the legal profession) and that brings to bear some of the genuinely useful insights that modern legal scholarship has produced.  Other mass media - television, radio, newspapers, and magazines - have proven inadequate to the task.  The blogosphere is the first medium that permits an informal and yet sophisticated discussion of legal issues and holds out the potential for directly affecting the public debate.  At the same time, I feel uncomfortable writing an essay that endorses blogging too enthusiastically.  Is it possible that I'm having so much fun blogging that I am fooling myself about its importance?  It's hard to judge when you're a tenured academic who is permitted to do whatever she thinks is best.  We're an over-indulged breed.

	",34.0,"This paper first documents the evolution of the cross-sectional income and consumption distribution in the US in the past 25 years. Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey we find that a rising income inequality has not been accompanied by a corresponding rise in consumption inequality.  Over the period from 1972 to 1998 the standard deviation of the log of after-tax labor income has increased by 20% while the standard deviation of log consumption has increased less than 2%. Furthermore income inequality has increased both between and within education groups while consumption inequality has increased between education groups but mildly declined within groups. We then argue that these empirical findings are consistent with the hypothesis that an increase in income volatility has been an important cause of the increase in income inequality, but at the same time has lead to an endogenous development of credit markets, allowing households to better smooth their consumption against idiosyncratic income fluctuations. We develop a consumption model in which the sharing of income risk is limited by imperfect enforcement of credit contracts and in which the development of financial markets depends on the volatility of the individual income process. This model is shown to be quantitatively consistent with the joint evolution of income and consumption inequality in US, while other commonly used consumption models are not.

	",24.0,"College students publicly rate their professors' teaching at RateMyProfessors.com, a web page where students anonymously judge their professors on Quality, Easiness, and Sexiness.  Using the data from this web site, we examine the relations between Quality, Easiness, and Sexiness for 3,190 professors at 25 universities.  For faculty with at least 10 student posts, the correlation between Quality and Easiness is 0.61, and the correlation between Quality and Sexiness is 0.30.  Using simple linear regression, we find that about half of the variation in Quality is a function of Easiness and Sexiness.  Accordingly, these results suggest that about half of the variation in student opinion survey scores used by universities for promotion, tenure, and teaching award decisions may be due to the easiness of the course and the sexiness of the professor. When grouped into sexy and non-sexy professors, the data reveal that students give sexy-rated professors higher Quality and Easiness scores. Based on these findings, universities need to rethink the use of student opinion surveys as a valid measure of teaching effectiveness.  High student opinion survey scores might well be viewed with suspicion rather than reverence, since they might indicate a lack of rigor, little student learning, and grade inflation.

The expression comes from the famous antitrust case of the 50's when the United States Supreme Court made an overly broad definition of the relevant market, thereby failing to detect the market power of du Pont, which held a virtual monopoly on cellophane. In the presence of a concentrated market structure the Merger Guidelines method (1982) also fails, leading to overestimation of the size of the relevant market. Given these similarities the Merger Guidelines Fallacy and the Cellophane Fallacy are generally taken to be identical.

	",100.0,"The limits of law in bringing about social change have long preoccupied legal thinkers. A recent development, however, is that new schools of thought build upon the critical understanding of these limits to produce a body of literature that privileges in a variety of ways extra-legal activism. These writings present themselves as alternatives to the path of legal reform, avoiding the risks of cooptation and deradicalization which have been the fate of earlier legalistic activism. Three extra-legal focal points emerge in this literature: (1) a move away from professionalism to ""lay lawyering""; (2) a move from the legal arena to an ""autonomous sphere"" of action; and (3) a departure from formal legal norms to softer, ""informal"" normativities. The article demonstrates how these recent developments are misdirected, as they draw erroneous conclusions from critical understandings about the cooptative risks of legal strategies. In particular, contemporary proposals of extra-legal reform strategies fail to recognize ways in which such alternatives are frequently subject to the same shortcomings they seek to evade by opting out of the legal arena. Linking historical examples of critical analysis of the labor and the civil rights movements to contemporary public interest literature, the article charts a more nuanced map of legal cooptation critiques, which include distinct claims about resources and energy, framing and fragmentation, lawyering and professionalism, crowding out effects, institutional limitations, and legitimation. The article argues that the contemporary manifestation of a critical legal consciousness has eclipsed the origins of critical theory, which situates various forms of social action on more equal grounds. The new extra-legal truism, which rejects law reform as a transformative path for social change, consequently risks reinforcing the very account that it sets out to resist - that the state is no longer able to ensure socially responsible practices in the 21st century economy.

	",,"The appropriate standard of protection for regulatory data (pharmaceutical and agro-chemical) under Article 39.3 of TRIPS is the subject of considerable controversy. This paper finds that the minimum standard mandated by Article 39.3 is neither one of data exclusivity (as argued by the US and EU) nor one of 'permissive reliance' (as argued by Professor Carlos Correa and others).   
Rather the term 'unfair commercial use' in Article 39.3 in effect envisages a 'compensatory liability' model, whereby regulatory data that complies with the pre-requisites of Article 39.3 (i.e. it relates to pharmaceutical or agricultural new chemical entities, is undisclosed and its origination involves considerable effort) cannot be used by any person, including a regulatory authority that uses such information to approve another product, without some compensation being paid to the originator of such data.

	",,"The article analyzes the American war on Iraq in its context with the U.S. National Security Strategy and its possible consequences for the development of public international law. The attack on Iraq without U.N. consent is illegal. A mandate for military actions against Iraq cannot be derived from existing Security Council resolutions. Unilateral use of military force can only be justified by self-defence. Anticipatory self-defense is only allowed, if the government can prove that a threat of an armed attack is imminent and leaves no choice of other means than military self-defense and no time to apply to the Security Council. In the present Iraq crisis the U.S. government cannot meet these criteria. By claiming a right to preemptive action, the U.S. government is pushing a change in public international law. If other States don't object a beginning practice of preemptive war, there could emerge a new rule of public international law that allows preemptive wars. Such a rule would leave it within the subjective discretion of each individual State to decide, whether another State is to be qualified as a ""rogue State"", poses a threat to international peace and can legally be attacked.  Nobody wants a new rule to become law, which would allow nearly every State to wage war against a lot of other States. Actually, the U.S. claims the right to preemptive action exclusively for itself. If the U.S. is successful in promoting this exclusive right to preemptive self-defense, then the fundamental principle of sovereign equality of States will be overthrown.

	",3.0,"This paper presents evidence of the extent to which omitting the value of pension benefits has undermined the accuracy of existing estimates of executive pay, its variability, and its sensitivity to performance.We study the pension arrangements of CEOs of S&P 500 companies that (1) are now serving and are near the retirement age; or (2) left their positions during 2003 and the first half of 2004. Roughly two-thirds of these CEO have a pension plan (or similar retirement arrangement), and our findings with respect to these CEOs are as follows:  
Â· The executives' pension plans had a median actuarial value of $15 million. Â· The ratio of the executives' pension value to the executives' total compensation (including both equity and non-equity pay) during their service as CEO had a median value of 34%. Â· Including pension values increased the median percentage of the executives' total compensation composed of salary-like payments during and after their service as CEO from 15% to 39%.  
In addition, the pension benefits in our sample varied considerably with respect to both their magnitude and their relationship to the executives' overall compensation. Our findings indicate that the standard omission of pension plan values by researchers and the media leads to:  
Â· Significant underestimation of the magnitude of executive compensation; Â· Severe distortions in comparisons among executive pay packages; and Â· Significant overestimation of the extent to which executive pay is linked to performance.

Through a review of the current literature, we propose and test hypotheses regarding bullying prevalence and dynamics relative to a sample of US workers.

Based upon past conceptualizations, as well as research that suggests bullying is a phenomenon that occurs in gradations, we introduce and provide statistical evidence for the construct and impact of bullying degree.

	",14.0,"Recent scholarship has argued that the comparative success of the Silicon Valley high technology industrial district and failure of Route 128 outside of Boston, resulted from different patterns of inter-firm employee mobility which, in turn, led to differing  patterns of industrial organization: network organization as opposed to traditional vertical integration. The cause of the different patterns of employee mobility is said to be cultural differences between California and Massachusetts. This paper offers a different causal analysis. After reviewing the new economic geography's emphasis on inter-firm knowledge transfers as an agglomeration economy, I focus on the critical role of employee mobility -- the vehicle for inter-firm knowledge transfers -- in facilitating second-stage agglomeration economies: those that allow the district to transcend its original product cycle and reinvent itself. In this account, the legal rules governing employee mobility are a causal antecedent of the construction of each district's culture. In fact, California law prohibits the most effective means of protecting trade secrets embodied in tacit knowledge -- a contractual post-employment covenant not to compete. Massachusetts law, in contrast, allows their enforcement. Consistent with the new economic geography's emphasis on path dependence, the paper shows that California's unusual legal regime dates back to the early 1870's, a serendipitous result of the historical coincidence between the codification movement in the United States and the problems confronting a new state in developing a coherent legal system. The paper concludes with a cautionary note concerning the implications of the analysis for three related subjects: the standard law and economic prescription to fully protect property rights in intellectual property; a disturbing recent line of cases concerning claims of ""inevitable disclosure"" that threatens to turn trade secret law into the judicial equivalent of a covenant not to compete; and the right strategy for policy analysts assessing reform of a region's legal system to encourage high technology industrial districts.

Included in this literature are experimental studies documenting the better performance of judges than jurors for the same case scenarios. Recent research by Eisenberg et al. (2002) has suggested, however, that there is no significant difference between the performance of judges and jurors with respect to punitive damages. Our paper provides a critical assessment of this finding as well as a detailed statistical analysis of the state court data upon which the Eisenberg et al. claim is based. Our analysis starts with a review of very large punitive damages awards. We found that 98 percent of the large punitive damages awards were made by juries and only two percent by judges. The jury awards in these large cases were highly unpredictable and were weakly correlated with compensatory damages. We then analyze data from the Civil Justice Survey of State Courts, 1996, which is the data set used by Eisenberg et al. Our analysis of the state court data set contradicts Eisenberg et al.'s analysis. We find that juries are significantly more likely to award punitive damages than are judges; juries award higher levels of punitive damages; and juries are largely responsible for extremely large punitive damages awards. Juries also tend to award higher compensatory damages, which in turn will often boost the punitive damages award.

			Jacobs,  Jan F., The One and Only Standard WACC - Cost of Capital versus Return on Capital (September 22, 2014).  Available at SSRN:  or 
		
	",27.0,"A lot of finance textbooks present calculation of WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) as: WACC = Kd - (1 -/- T)- D %   Ke - E %, whereas Kd is opportunity cost of debt before taxes, T is tax rate, D % is percentage of debt to total value, Ke is opportunity cost of equity and E % is percentage of equity to total value. Numerous textbooks state that D % and E % are market values, but the correct interpretation of these values is not sufficiently dealt with: which market values, what D/E-ratio? No matter how the financing is done, there is actually only one standard net WACC.  
WACC changes in time, one needs an up-to-date WACC, yes indeed, but what and how exactly? In short, many questions still remain, but up to the present they do not have unequivocal answers. The purpose of this paper is to clear up these questions and emphasize in some ideas that usually are overlooked. Famous writers, e.g., Pablo Fernandez, Ignacio Velez-Pareja and Joseph Tham, claim: to calculate the firm's value it is necessary to know the WACC-figure, but to calculate WACC, the firm's value (among other data like the financing profile) is needed. Indeed, one needs to know the WACC in order to calculate the firm's value. However, to calculate WACC, several data are truly needed, just not the firm's value. Many misconceptions exist about firm valuation and the valuation of tax shields (VTS) as well as the correct calculation of WACC.  
Although Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (MM for short) were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, their Propositions I and II appear to be clearly incorrect. Many theories and much advise is flawed by the demasque of MM's Proposition I (1958, equation 3), which states in the absence of taxes, the firm's value is independent of its debt. The so-called proof given by MM is not a mathematical proof. It was and is a statement that cannot stand the test. Proposition I is not true; re SSRN_ID609102. Consequently, everything based on Proposition I is not true either. This paper repudiates Proposition II, constituting Ke being a cost to the firm and similarly a return to the equity investor. Ke and WACC are measuring costs, just costs. Return and cost values coincide at intersect-points only of clearly divergent return and respectively cost functions.

	",156.0,"This paper considers the legal and cultural meaning of circumcision, the most commonly performed operation on men in the United States. The paper explores three periods of American history in which circumcision has had very different meanings. Before the turn of the Twentieth Century, circumcision was uncommon and generally disapproved. During the first part of this century, and until recently, the operation became increasingly frequent - first as a cure for disease (especially masturbation), and later as a routine prophylactic measure performed on newborn boys. Beginning in the 1980s, an anti-circumcision movement has developed in the United States and elsewhere in the world that attempts to reverse the positive cultural meanings the operation achieved earlier in the century. The paper uses the case of circumcision to explore the social construction of the Good. It argues that our culture's concept of the Good is organized around certain key polarities: purity and pollution, health and harm, self and other, natural and unnatural, beauty and deformity, gender-appropriate and gender-inappropriate, order and chaos, good and bad, and true and false. The article demonstrates how the cultural meaning of circumcision changed along each of these dimensions during the last hundred years.

	",,"Whenever civil liberties issues are contested, proponents of greater restrictions often chide civil liberties defenders for being unwilling to offer moderate concessions. Frequently, persons advocating restrictions on civil liberties claim that the ""moderate"" restriction will not infringe the core civil liberty. When rights advocates raise the ""slippery slope"" argument, they are criticized for being excessively fearful. The goal of the article is to refine our understanding of ""slippery slopes"" by examining a case in which a civil liberty really did slide all the way down the slippery slope.   
The right to arms in Great Britain was entirely unrestricted at the beginning of the twentieth century; as the century ends, the right is dead, and only a feeble, severely constricted privilege to possess certain ""sporting"" guns remains. The article examines, step-by step, how Britain moved from a strong, unfettered right to near-total prohibition of that right. While each of Britain's incremental steps towards gun control was, in itself, reasonable, the cumulative effect was to destroy the right gradually.   
Although the right to arms is the focus of the article, the article also discusses many other civil liberties, and their fate in twentieth century Britain and America. The article concludes that, in light of historical experience, organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association of America, which vigorously resist even the smallest perceived infringements on constitutional rights, may be acting prudently in the long term, even though their ""no concessions"" stance may appear unreasonable in the short term.

	",52.0,"In this paper, we assess empirically the effect of two requirements set by the SOX (audit committee entirely composed of independent members and at least one member is financially knowledgeable) and four requirements set by the NYSE (majority of independent directors in the board, audit committee with a minimum of three members, each member of the audit committee has to be financially literate, and at least one member of the audit committee must have accounting knowledge) on the corporate risk management activity. We also investigate the effect of having a majority of financially knowledgeable directors on the board as well as the importance of university education for directors sitting on the board and on the audit committee. We construct a novel hand collected dataset that allows us to explore multiple definitions for a director who is financially knowledgeable: a director who is financially active, a director who is financially educated and finally a director who has an accounting background. We find that the new requirements on the audit committee size and independence are reasonable, although maintaining a majority of unrelated directors in the board and a director with an accounting background in the audit committee may not be necessary. Interestingly, financially educated directors seem to encourage corporate hedging while financially active directors and those with an accounting background play no active role in such policy. This evidence combined with the positive relation we report between the firm's risk management level and its performance suggests that shareholders are better off with financially educated directors on their boards and audit committees. Our empirical evidence also show that university education for the directors sitting on the board, but not those sitting on the audit committee is an important determinant of the hedging level. Indeed, our measure of risk management is found to be a decreasing function of the proportion of directors with only a bachelor degree and an increasing function of the percentage of directors holding a degree superior to a bachelor. This result is the first direct evidence concerning the importance of university education for the board of directors.

	",74.0,"This paper offers a critique of recent empirical research on the impact of labour regulation on industrial performance in India. It begins with a review of earlier studies that tried to infer the effects on manufacturing employment of amendments made by the central government to the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) in 1976 and 1982, requiring official permission for layoffs, retrenchments and closures. The results of these studies are ambiguous, and this literature ignored crucial developments in the political and legal spheres which vitiate many of these findings. The widely-used index of state-level labour regulation devised by Besley and Burgess (Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2004) is then criticised for its miscoding of individual amendments and its misleading aggregation and cumulation procedures. Their econometric results, which indicate that states that enacted excessively pro-worker amendments to the IDA have displayed poorer performance in manufacturing, do not appear to be robust and also suffer from other methodological problems. Several recent studies that have used the Besley-Burgess index are also surveyed, and their limitations highlighted. Finally, the paper reviews a wide range of other evidence, pointing in a very different direction, on the actual enforcement of labour laws, labour flexibility, and industrial employment. Throughout, attention is paid to the crucial role of judicial interpretation of the IDA, which has been neglected in this literature.

	",9.0,"Canada's cleverly named Passenger Protect Program, which is nothing less than a ""No-Fly"" List, is set to take off in the spring of 2007.  This article identifies and explores many of the concerns with the new program and concludes that it will have profound impact on fundamental liberties, human rights, privacy rights and poses a serious threat of racial/religious profiling.  The article argues that the Passenger Protect Program must be debated and thoroughly investigated by Parliament.  The fig leaf process of canvassing regulatory comment, ex post facto, instituted to attempt to give this initiative legitimacy falls far short of what is required.     
The article questions how there could be a list of suspected terrorists and sympathizers so dangerous to fly, yet so innocent that they can roam Canadian streets so freely?      
The article concludes that what is needed is not this list, but better investigative and intelligence work to gather evidence so that those who are real threats are charged and kept off the streets, not just flights.  In the alternative, if it is proven that such a list is necessary and effective, then the minimum standards of due process, principles of fundamental justice, accountability, transparency, and oversight must be incorporated into the program.

Except for very large trades, spreads on bonds whose prices become more transparent decline relative to bonds that experience no transparency change.  However, we find no effects of transparency for very infrequently traded bonds.

	",5.0,"The financial privacy law passed by Congress in 1999 has been the target of scathing criticism.  Financial institutions have complained about the high costs of the billions of notices sent to consumers, apparently to widespread consumer indifference.  On the other side, privacy advocates have condemned the law as woefully weak.    
This article disagrees with the criticisms.  Part I describes the main provisions of Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, showing a better match with basic privacy principles than many have realized.  Part II explores the history of how GLB became law, placing the enactment into the context of a historic peak of privacy policy activity in the late 1990s.  This history draws on my dual perspective, as an academic who has written extensively about financial and other privacy issues, and as the Clinton Administration's Chief Counselor for Privacy during the period.    
Part III looks at the most hotly contested issue in the privacy debate, the rules for sharing personal information with affiliated entities and third parties.  GLB establishes a basic rule that information can flow freely within a financial institution and to its affiliates.  Customer choice - an opt out ability to prevent sharing - applies for transfers to non-affiliated companies.  The article argues that an exception to that principle of customer choice, the ""joint marketing exception""  should be repealed.  It then explores the knotty issue of how to handle data sharing in today's vast financial conglomerates, suggesting possible statutory modifications.    
Part IV looks at the much-maligned notices that financial institutions have sent out in compliance with GLB.  The critics have accurately complained about the legalistic and detailed language in the current notices.  The critics have largely overlooked, however, important benefits from these notices.  Publication of the notices and the new legal obligation to comply with them have forced financial institutions to engage in considerable self-scrutiny of their data handling practices.  Many firms have hired a Chief Privacy Officer or made other institutional changes.  The current notices, even in their imperfect form, have reduced the risk of egregious privacy practices.  And improved notices, with a plain-language short form on top, would enhance accountability while also communicating far more clearly with ordinary customers.    
In short, there are surprising merits of the GLB privacy provisions.  Considerably more was accomplished in the Act than observers would have predicted in the spring of 1999 or than critics have recognized to date.  Important flaws do exist, but specific and achievable changes in the statute and implementing regulation can go far toward reducing the magnitude of those flaws.

Using the difference in implied volatility between pairs of call and put options to measure these deviations we find that stocks with relatively expensive calls outperform stocks with relatively expensive puts by 51 basis points per week. We find both positive abnormal performance in stocks with relatively expensive calls and negative abnormal performance in stocks with relatively expensive puts, a result which cannot be explained by short sales constraints. Using rebate rates from the stock lending market, we confirm directly that our findings are not driven by stocks that are hard to borrow. Options with more leverage generate greater predictability. Controlling for size, deviations from put-call parity are more likely to occur in options with underlying stocks that face more information risk. Deviations from put-call parity also tend to predict returns to a larger extent in firms that face a more asymmetric information environment, and in firms with high residual analyst coverage. We also find that the degree of predictability decreases over the sample period. Our results are consistent with mispricing during the earlier years of the study, with a gradual reduction of the mispricing over time.

	",53.0,"The DVD video format has become one of the most important developments in the home entertainment market since the popularisation of the magnetic video recording. The film industry delivered this format with a built in security system which was supposed to avoid illegal copying of the discs, much as what is taking place with the music CD and the almost indiscriminate copying of music into MP3 format over the Internet. This was achieved by means of encryption technology. This essay deals with the cracking of DVD encryption and its further diffusion as a computer programme named DeCSS, which has been made available over the Internet in various formats, including t-shirts and a numerical representation of the code. There are three court cases based on the online posting of this programme, two in the United States and one in Norway. The article starts by describing the technology involved, as it is felt by the author that some of these technical issues are of importance to the legal implications of the case and should be understood properly.

	",52.0,"For many years, institutional psychiatry was a major tool in the suppression of political dissent. Moreover, it appears painfully clear that, while the worst excesses of the past have mostly disappeared, the problem is not limited to the pages of history. What is more, the revelations of the worst of these abuses (and the concomitant rectification  of many of them) may, paradoxically, have created the false illusion that all the major problems attendant to questions of institutional treatment and conditions in these nations have been solved. This is decidedly not so.    
Remarkably, the issue of the human rights of persons with mental disabilities had been ignored for decades by the international agencies vested with the protection of human rights on a global scale. For people with mental disabilities, in particular, the development of human rights protections may be even more significant than for people with other disabilities. Like people with other disabilities, people with mental disabilities face degradation, stigmatization, and discrimination throughout the world today. But unlike people with other disabilities, many people with mental disabilities are routinely confined, against their will, in institutions, and deprived of their freedom, dignity, and basic human rights. People with mental disabilities who are fortunate enough to live outside of institutions often remain imprisoned by the social isolation they experience, often from their own families. They are not included in educational programs, and they face attitudinal barriers to employment because they have not received the education and training needed to obtain employment or because of discrimination based on unsubstantiated fears and prejudice. Only recently have disability discrimination laws and policies in the United States and elsewhere focused on changing such attitudes and promoting the integration of people with disabilities into our schools, neighborhoods, and workplaces.    
The question remains, however: to what extent has institutional, state-sponsored psychiatry been used as a tool of political suppression, and what are the implications of this pattern and practice? After an Introductory section (Part I), I discuss, in Part II, the first revelations of the dehumanization inflicted on persons with mental disabilities, primarily (but not exclusively) in Soviet Bloc nations. In Part III, I discuss developments after these revelations were publicized. In Part IV, I weigh the extent to which the post-revelation reforms have been effective and meaningful. In Part V, I explain the meanings of sanism and pretextuality, and discuss how they relate to the topic at hand. Then, in Part VI, I raise questions that have not yet been answered, and that, I believe, should help set the research agendas of those thinking about these important issues.

One supposed advantage of the network form is a greater capacity for the transfer of evidence-based or 'best' practices across the network and accelerated organizational learning. Such networks may have a knowledge management role and stimulate the formation of 'communities of practice'. This article tests these arguments using data from a study of managed NHS cancer networks in London. The general pattern was for networks to concentrate on structural reconfiguration, while their knowledge management role remained marginal.

	",70.0,"Copyright law provides an excellent case study with which to study and evaluate Harold Demsetz's theory of property rights. Regardless of how one feels about the relationship between property and intellectual property, it is hard to escape the fact that intellectual property rights have expanded and grown more property-like and more privatized in recent decades. There has been an undeniable Demsetzian trend in copyright law.    
In this article, I critique the Demsetzian trend in copyright law and challenge some of the fundamental premises upon which the normative arguments for continued privatization and propertization of intellectual resources rest. First, I focus on the perceived benefits of internalizing externalities. I argue that externalities do not necessarily distort incentives or, more generally, the market allocation of resources. For many externalities, there is no efficiency benefit to internalization (whether internalization is accomplished by Pigouvian taxes/subsidies or property rights). In the end, the benefits of internalization must be carefully assessed rather than assumed. The view that increasing the degree of internalization through private property rights inevitably leads to increased incentives to invest in creation or distribution is not well-established in either theory or practice.    
Second, I focus on the frequently invoked solution of efficient licensing and the ""logic"" that property rights should be extended ""into every corner in which people derive enjoyment and value . . . [so that] signals of consumer preference [may] trigger and direct [producers'] investments"" (Goldstein, 1994). I argue that there is a fundamental flaw in this logic that undermines the efficient licensing hypothesis. Social demand for individuals' access to and use of copyright protected works often exceeds private demand. Purchasers'/licensees' willingness to pay reflects only their private demand and does not take into account value that others might realize as a result of their use. As I explain, many uses of copyrighted works generate value for third-parties.    
Finally, drawing from the first two points, I argue that, from a Coasean perspective, both externalities and property rights have symmetrical and reciprocal potentials to distort the market allocation of resources. A priori and devoid of context, one cannot say that the potential distortions caused by a property right, externality, or incremental change in a property right have a net positive or negative effect on social welfare.

In equilibrium, only the first component earns a risk premium. Therefore investors should avoid exposure to the residual component. All nominal bonds, including the money-market account, have constant nominal cash flows and thus their real returns are equally exposed to residual inflation risk. In contrast, inflation-protected bonds provide a means to avoid cash flow and residual inflation risk. Hence, every investor should put 100% of her wealth in real assets (inflation- protected bonds, stocks, corporate bonds, real estate, commodities, etc.), and finance every long/short position in nominal bonds with an equal amount of other nominal bonds or by borrowing/lending cash, that is, investors should hold a zero-investment portfolio of nominal bonds and cash.

	",97.0,"We present a positive model of integrity that, as we distinguish and define integrity, provides powerful access to increased performance for individuals, groups, organizations, and societies. Our model reveals the causal link between integrity and increased performance, quality of life, and value-creation for all entities, and provides access to that causal link. Integrity is thus a factor of production as important as knowledge and technology, yet its major role in productivity and performance has been largely hidden or unnoticed, or even ignored by economists and others.  
The philosophical discourse, and common usage as reflected in dictionary definitions, leave an overlap and confusion among the four phenomena of integrity, morality, ethics, and legality. This overlap and confusion confound the four phenomena so that the efficacy and potential power of each is seriously diminished.   
In this new model, we distinguish all four phenomena - integrity, morality, ethics, and legality - as existing within two separate realms. Integrity exists in a positive realm devoid of normative content. Integrity is thus not about good or bad, or right or wrong, or what should or should not be. Morality, ethics and legality exist in a normative realm of virtues (that is, they are about good and bad, right and wrong, or what should or should not be). Furthermore, within their respective realms, each of the four phenomena is distinguished as belonging to a distinct and separate domain, and the definition of each as a term is made clear, unambiguous, and non-overlapping.  
We distinguish the domain of integrity as the objective state or condition of an object, system, person, group, or organizational entity, and, consistent with the first two of the three definitions in Webster's dictionary, define integrity as a state or condition of being whole, complete, unbroken, unimpaired, sound, perfect condition.  
We assert that integrity (the condition of being whole and complete) is a necessary condition for workability, and that the resultant level of workability determines the available opportunity for performance. Hence, the way we treat integrity in our model provides an unambiguous and actionable access to the opportunity for superior performance, no matter how one defines performance.  
For an individual we distinguish integrity as a matter of that person's word being whole and complete. For a group or organizational entity we define integrity as that group's or organization's word being whole and complete. A group's or organization's word consists of what is said between the people in that group or organization, and what is said by or on behalf of the group or organization. In that context, we define integrity for an individual, group, or organization as: honoring one's word.  
Oversimplifying somewhat, honoring your word, as we define it, means you either keep your word, or as soon as you know that you will not, you say that you will not be keeping your word to those who were counting on your word and clean up any mess you caused by not keeping your word. By keeping your word we mean doing what you said you would do and by the time you said you would do it.  
Honoring your word is also the route to creating whole and complete social and working relationships. In addition, it provides an actionable pathway to earning the trust of others.  
We demonstrate that the application of cost-benefit analysis to honoring your word guarantees that you will be untrustworthy. And that, with one exception, you will not be a person of integrity, thereby reducing both the workability of your life and your opportunity for performance. The one exception to this form of being out of integrity is, if when giving your word you have announced that you will apply cost-benefit analysis to honoring your word. In this case you have maintained your integrity, but you have also announced that you are an unmitigated opportunist. The virtually automatic application of cost-benefit analysis to one's integrity (an inherent tendency in most of us) lies at the heart of much out-of-integrity and untrustworthy behavior in modern life.  
Regarding the relationship between integrity, and the three virtue phenomena of morality, ethics and legality, this new model: 1) encompasses all four terms in one consistent theory, 2) makes clear and unambiguous the moral compasses potentially available in each of the three virtue phenomena, and 3) by revealing the relationship between honoring the standards of the three virtue phenomena and performance (including being complete as a person and the quality of life), raises the likelihood that the now clear moral compasses can actually shape human behavior. This all falls out primarily from the unique treatment of integrity in our model as a purely positive phenomenon, independent of normative value judgments.  
In summary, we show that defining integrity as honoring one's word (as we have defined honoring one's word): 1) provides an unambiguous and actionable access to the opportunity for superior performance and competitive advantage at both the individual and organizational level, and 2) empowers the three virtue phenomena of morality, ethics and legality.

	",36.0,"This article argues that the common wisdom on the USA Patriot Act is wrong.  Far from being a significant expansion of law enforcement powers online, the Patriot Act actually changed Internet surveillance law in only minor ways and added several key privacy protections.  The article focuses on three specific provisions of the Patriot Act: the provision applying the pen register law to the Internet, the provisions relating to Carnivore, and the new computer trespasser exception to the Wiretap Act.  By explaining the basic framework of surveillance law and applying it to the Patriot Act, the author shows how the Internet surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act updated the law in ways that both law enforcement and civil libertarians should appreciate.

	",63.0,"Recently commentators have championed sentencing by jury as more democratic, less sensitive to electoral pressure, and better suited to current theories of punishment than sentencing by judge alone. Despite the importance of reliable empirical information about jury sentencing, contemporary discussions of this practice either fail to address empirical questions or rely on outdated and incomplete studies. This study is the first to present basic information on the comparative severity and variance of jury and judge sentencing as practiced at the turn of the twenty-first century. We present offense-specific analyses of the variance and severity of jury sentences as compared to judge sentences, controlling for available factors associated with sentence severity, using several years of archival sentencing data from Arkansas and Virginia. In both states, juries select sentences in felony cases after jury trial. Judicial sentencing after bench trial or guilty plea is governed by voluntary sentencing guidelines. Regression analyses evaluated sentences of incarceration for individual offenses, and included as independent variables available offense, offender, and case characteristics associated with sentence severity. For most of the offenses examined in these two states, the sentences selected by juries after trial were both more varied and more severe than sentences selected by judges after bench trial. The findings also suggest that these disparities may be deliberately maintained by judges and prosecutors and facilitated by state law that restricts the sentencing options and information provided to juries as compared to judges.

	",37.0,"The granting of parole in the criminal justice system is often viewed as an act of grace: the dispensation of mercy by the government to an individual prisoner deemed worthy of conditional release prior to the expiration of his sentence. Yet the criteria upon which state parole boards base these acts of grace remain something of a mystery. Denials of parole are largely unreviewable and courts have held that due process imposes only a minimal burden upon parole boards to reveal the rationales for their decisions. Nevertheless, surveying state parole release decisions demonstrates that a prisoner's willingness to own up to his misdeeds - to acknowledge culpability and express remorse for the crime for which he is currently incarcerated - is a vital part of the parole decision-making calculus. That is, admitting guilt increases the likelihood of a favorable parole outcome for an inmate whereas proclaiming innocence serves to diminish the chance for release. The main objective of this Article is to consider whether this is wise. Should a prisoner's assertions of innocence be held against him in the parole process?       
Part I of this Article briefly discusses the origins of parole in the United States as well as the contemporary features of parole release decision-making. Next, Part II explores how the reliance on prisoner admissions of guilt as part of the parole release decision intersects and potentially interferes with the efforts of innocent inmates to win their freedom. Part III then critically examines the theoretical and normative implications of the current parole system's emphasis on remorse and responsibility. Finally, Part IV recommends several specific reforms concerning the treatment of inmate claims of innocence at parole hearings. These reforms include limiting the use of parole hearing transcripts at subsequent post-conviction proceedings; distinguishing statements of remorse from those of responsibility; and re-conceiving the role played by parole boards in entertaining questions of guilt and innocence.

Given Singapore's position as the crossroads of Asia, the law must be able to cope with the flow of objects in and out of the country. The law is currently deficient as it is not tailored to deal with issues concerning cultural heritage, and needs to be reformed in several respects.

Unlike a similar scheme suggested previously by Vickrey, the present one does not require knowledge of the potentially unobservable pattern of gains over time.

	",120.0,"It is widely assumed that the Ninth Amendment languished in constitutional obscurity until it was resurrected in Griswold v. Connecticut by Justice Arthur Goldberg. In fact, the Ninth Amendment played a significant role in some of the most important constitutional disputes in our nation's history, including the scope of exclusive versus concurrent federal power, the authority of the federal government to regulate slavery, the constitutionality of the New Deal, and the legitimacy and scope of incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment. The second of two articles addressing the Lost History of the Ninth Amendment, The Lost Jurisprudence takes a comprehensive look at the Ninth Amendment jurisprudence which flourished from the early nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century. Long assumed never to have received significant attention from the Supreme Court, in fact the first discussion and application of the Ninth Amendment was by none other than Justice Joseph Story himself.  In a passage unnoticed since the nineteenth century, Justice Story interpreted and applied the Ninth Amendment precisely the way James Madison and the state ratifying conventions intended; as a rule of construction preserving the retained right of local self-government. Ignored by the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment and its attendant rule of construction were deployed by courts throughout the nineteenth century to limit the interpretation of federal powers and rights.  Ubiquitously paired with the Tenth Amendment, the Ninth suffered the same fate as the Tenth at the time of the New Deal, when both were rendered mere truisms in the face of expansive constructions of federal power.  By 1965, the Ninth was assumed to exist in a doctrinal and historical vacuum, an assumption that no one has questioned until now.

	",32.0,"The Article concerns the intersection of and relationship between school finance litigation and school desegregation.  The central contention is that school finance reform has been and will continue to be hamstrung by the obstacles created by poor race relations and the Court's desegregation jurisprudence. As I explain, residential segregation and the limited reach of school desegregation have helped to create and maintain schools that are isolated not simply by race, but also by socioeconomic status. The effects of such isolation, this Article suggests, cannot be adequately addressed by school finance reform, as students in schools with high concentrations of poverty need more than increased funding to improve achievement.    
To put the argument simply:  although it is possible that school finance could have been a helpful supplement to desegregation, it is a poor substitute.  Despite the hopes of early school finance advocates, we should not expect school finance reform to solve the problems created by the failure to desegregate many urban schools.  Indeed, this Article suggests that school finance reform has not only done little to improve the academic performance of students in predominantly minority districts, but that it may also be a costly distraction from the more productive policy of integration. After fleshing out this argument, I suggest two approaches - reorienting school ""finance"" cases and shaping school choice - that could be used to increase racial and socioeconomic integration.

	",,"The culture refers to the social heritage of a people, those learned patterns for thinking, feeling, and acting that are transmitted from one generation to the next, including the embodiment of these patterns in material items (Hughes et al., 2002: 41). Therefore, every nation, tribe or nation is characterised by a set of patterns, idioms, and/or myths, elements sustaining their social heritage. Unfortunately, some injustices, prejudices and other developments in the history of a group may bring an end to these elements and consequently disrupt their social cohesion. In Africa, after years of battle for ""political independence"", many countries acknowledged the disruption of the cohesion of their society.  In the case of Cameroon, the Banen tribe was in the forefront of a fierce opposition for the occupation of successive colonial powers, Germany and France.  
France brought a severe repression to this particular tribe and contributed to their dislocation in more than four regions (Littoral, South, South West and Centre) of Cameroon. The tribe Banen part of the Bantoide group previously living around the region of high mountains of the West Coast of Cameroon, in a surface of about 10000 kilometers squares, are now found scattered in a periphery of more than three hundred kilometers in the areas of Ndikinimeki, Nitouckou, EdÃ©a, Douala, Ebolowa, Penja, and Yingui. Some dialects like the Bassa used to have the Tunen (Banen dialect) as their language of communication. Under the German rulership during the 1880s, a referendum was organised in the previously Banen areas which are the current Ndockmakumak village (Babimbi II), the Logkat village and the Ndobianga village. The question asked to the populations was to tell if they prefer joining NgambÃ¨ (the Bassa main city) or stay under Yingui (the Banen city) dominion. Unfortunately, these populations accepted to join NgambÃ¨ situated in the Bassa tribe, and these populations are now considered as being Bassa.  More recently, the population called 'Banen Ba Ngwanga' speak the Bassa dialect while they are from the Banen tribe.  
As it has been mentioned above, the dispersion of the Banen brought the lost of their culture, and more importantly of their dialect, the Tunen that has four main sub dialects namely: the Topoigne, the Alinga, the Ndocktuna and the Effombo. Being approximately 10 per cent of the whole population of Cameroon during the 1990s (Balhiki, 2005), it will be unfortunate for Cameroon as a country to lose this important social and cultural heritage. Therefore, what need to be done in order to bring back the Banen heritage fifty years after the repression of the French colonial master and more than a century after the German referendum?  
The present paper is an attempt to explore ways and means, which may be undertaken to reverse the situation by using the New Partnership for Africaâ€™s Development (NEPAD), the sustainable development goals and the cultural development pillars. The ideas developed within the NEPAD framework and the development pillars coined by Professor Alain Ndedi are not panaceas to the plights and ills faced by the Banen tribe, but must be seen as a contribution to the restoration of the pride lost by more than 2 millions of Cameroonians.

	",11.0,"This article considers the ramifications of current efforts to internationalize the regulation of corporate social  responsibility. The primary focus will be on current United  Nations efforts to regulate transnational corporations through  the development of its Norms on the Responsibilities of  Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises With  Regard to Human Rights. The Norms are critically important for  two reasons. First, the Norms themselves point to the evolution of fundamental changes in global thinking about corporations, the character and source of their regulation that together will have significant ramifications for American domestic law. The Norms evidence an increasing taste, at the international level, for a shift from a private to a public law basis for corporate regulation. The corporate social responsibility debate is ultimately a debate about the fundamental character of corporations as principally private or public entities. Second, the development and continued life of the Norms and the ideas it embodies illustrate the development of a mechanics of interplay between national, international, public and private law systems in allocating, and competing, for power to regulate. The  regularization and institutionalization of these mechanics evidence transnational law coming into its own as a separate field of power.     
The article first briefly describes the traditional domestic context of the debates about so-called corporate social responsibility and its relation to basic issues of corporate governance. The article then turns to the changing context in which the Norms were conceived. A critical analysis of the Norms in this context points to potential critical changes in global consensus with significant ramifications for American domestic law. First, the Norms considerably alter the framework of the debate about corporate social responsibility.  Corporations, seen as social, political, and economic actors,  would serve not merely a broadened set of traditional stakeholders, but also the state and international community as well.    
Traditional constraints on action against shareholders, and especially corporate shareholders, would be effectively  disregarded for virtually all purposes. Second, the Norms enlist transnational corporations as agents of international law implementation, even against states that have either refused to ratify certain international instruments or have objected to the gloss advanced by international institutions. The Norms create an effective system for the implementation of international law norms through private law. The Norms are implemented through the law of contract between individuals rather than by treaty or state action. Because the Norms are based on a number of international instruments that have not been ratified by all states, the Norms use transnational corporations as a means of end-running states, and in the process, create the basis for the articulation of customary international law principles that will apply to states. Third, the Norms substantially alter the balance of power over corporate governance between inside stakeholders (shareholders, lenders, etc) and outside stakeholders (community, society, the state) by providing a substantial role to NGOs to monitor TNC conformity to the requirements of the Norms.     
The article ends with a preliminary consideration of the Norms in a broader context. It analyses the Norms, not as substance, but as symptom of two great fundamental changes in the allocation of governance power in a global setting. First, it illustrates rearrangements in the relative power of systems of domestic, international, public and private systems of governance. Second, the Norms provide a template for the character and form of interaction and communication, among these systems of governance.

The difficulty with such a claim is that there are likely to be omitted cohort effects (earlier generations may have been born in, say, particularly good or bad times).  Hence the apparent U may be an artifact.  Using data on approximately 500,000 Americans and Europeans, this paper designs a test that makes it possible to allow for different birth-cohorts.  A robust U-shape of happiness in age is found.  Ceteris paribus, well-being reaches a minimum, on both sides of the Atlantic, in people's mid to late 40s.  The paper also shows that in the United States the well-being of successive birth-cohorts has gradually fallen through time.  In Europe, newer birth-cohorts are happier.

The causes of such practices and the market forces that can rein them in are discussed. A case study of one mortgage servicer describes its unfair treatment of borrowers and the reforms imposed by federal regulators and other market participants. Both regulatory agencies and rating agencies appear to have increased their scrutiny of servicers' behavior, and states have passed new legislation to limit abuse.

This result is driven primarily by the impact on non-users (people who did not previously attend the gym), as regular users are essentially unaffected.  We observe no difference across gender.

There are increasing reasons to question this assumption. Both economic theory and recent empirical research demonstrate that failing to compensate private landowners for the costs of environmental regulations discourages voluntary conservation efforts and can encourage the destruction of environmental resources. The lack of a compensation requirement also means that land-use regulation is underpriced as compared to other environmental protection measures for which government agencies must pay. This results in the ""overconsumption"" of land-use regulations relative to other environmental protection measures that could be more cost-effective at advancing conservation goals.

	",62.0,"It has long been the conventional wisdom that American criminal law is too broad and too harsh, that it criminalizes too much and punishes too severely.  It has also long been the conventional wisdom that these problems flow directly out of electoral politics.  This article argues that, while the first piece of conventional wisdom is right, the second is wrong.  Criminal law's breadth and severity flow not from electoral politics but from institutional politics, from the interacting incentives of prosecutors, legislators, and judges.  Prosecutorial discretion gives legislators a strong incentive to broaden liability rules, which in turn give prosecutors more discretion.  Courts are thereby cut out of the lawmaking process.  The result is that criminal law, as it expands, does less and less work - the real boundaries of criminal liability are defined by law enforcers, not by the law.  And ironically, the doctrines that aim to ensure the ""rule of law"" reinforce that result.    
The article goes on to explore, sketchily, some solutions to this problem of institutional design.  The most promising solutions involve a substantial increase in judicial power over criminal law - more precisely, a substantial degree of constitutionalization of criminal law.  As that hardly seems likely anytime in the foreseeable future, the problems that afflict American criminal law are likely to get worse before they get better.

Two methods are proposed: the first method is based on a coherent risk measure compatible with market prices of derivatives, while the second method is based on a convex risk measure. Our measures of model risk lead to a premium for model uncertainty which is comparable to other risk measures and compatible with observations of market prices of a set of benchmark derivatives.

A significant percentage of the public - the vast majority of whom will never be in peril of institutionalization - exhibit some sort of serious mental illness during their lifetime. A much larger percentage exhibits some sign of mental disability or mental disorder. And this population - like the rest of the population - frequently has problems that require resolution by a lawyer and the legal system, among them, contract problems, property problems, domestic relations problems, and trusts and estates problems.

	",174.0,"The Supreme Court's controversial recent decision in Kelo v. City of New London upheld the condemnation of private property for purposes of economic development. This Article argues that Kelo was wrongly decided and that courts should forbid condemnations for economic development.    
Part I analyzes the flaws of economic development takings generally.  Such condemnations allow politically powerful interest groups to capture the condemnation process for the purpose of enriching themselves at the expense of the poor and politically weak.  Economic development takings are especially vulnerable to abuse because their rationale can justify almost any condemnation that transfers property to a commercial enterprise. Several other aspects of economic development takings also exacerbate the danger.    
This Part also shows that the need to eliminate holdout problems that could block desirable assembly projects cannot justify permitting economic development takings. In most cases, private developers can prevent holdouts by such noncoercive methods as assembling property in secret and adopting precommitment strategies that prevent holdouts from using their bargaining power.    
Part II considers the major alternatives to a categorical ban. While these proposals are not without merit, none can prevent eminent domain abuse as effectively as forbidding the economic development rationale altogether. The first such alternative, adopted for a time by courts in Michigan and Delaware, is to require heightened scrutiny in cases where the condemnation power is used in a way that benefits identifiable private interests. Unfortunately, the heightened scrutiny test is not an adequate bulwark against the dangers of economic development takings, and may in some cases actually exacerbate those risks.  The same weaknesses bedevil academic proposals to impose means-ends scrutiny on takings, which bear a considerable resemblance to the heightened scrutiny test.    
Increasing the compensation awarded to property owners targeted for condemnation is another possible alternative to a ban. While this idea has some merit, it is almost impossible to accurately calculate the appropriate amount of compensation for subjective value. Moreover, even a perfect compensation formula cannot offset the damage inflicted by economic development takings on taxpayers and the community as a whole.    
Many defenders of the Kelo decision advocate procedural protections for property owners as an alternative to vigorous judicial enforcement of public use limitations on takings. Though such protections have real value, they are unlikely to be an adequate substitute for a judicial ban on economic development takings.    
Lastly, it is possible that strong judicial review of economic development takings is unnecessary because localities that abuse their eminent domain powers will be disciplined by interjurisdictional competition in a federal system. While exit rights are a valuable tool for forcing governments to respect the needs and interests of citizens, they have only limited utility in protecting property rights in land because real property is an immobile asset that owners cannot take with them when they vote with their feet.    
In Part III, I consider the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo. In advocating broad deference to local governments on public use issues, the Kelo majority unfortunately ignored the serious defects in the political processes that control economic development takings. The Court's analysis of history and precedent also has significant weaknesses, particularly in its heavy reliance on early twentieth century precedents that were based on substantive due process rather than on the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Nonetheless, Kelo actually represents a modest improvement on the Court's previous public use decisions, by holding out the possibility of at least slightly greater judicial scrutiny.    
A final important aspect of Kelo is the strong political reaction against it, which has led Congress and numerous state legislatures to consider legislation restricting the use of eminent domain. Unfortunately, my analysis shows that most of the proposed legislation is likely to have little or no effect and may simply represent position-taking intended to mollify public opinion without actually constraining the use of eminent domain.    
Part IV strikes an additional note of caution, showing that even a categorical ban on economic development takings is not a comprehensive solution to the underlying problem of eminent domain abuse. A ban on economic development takings can potentially be circumvented in several ways, most notably because such bans still permit condemnations to alleviate blight.

	",31.0,"Exchange rate regime optimality, as well as monetary policy effectiveness, depends on the tightness of the link between exchange rate movements and import prices. Recent debates hinge on whether producer-currency-pricing (PCP) or local currency pricing (LCP) of imports is more prevalent, and on whether exchange rate pass-through rates are endogenous to a country's macroeconomic conditions. We provide cross-country and time series evidence on both of these issues for the imports of twenty-five OECD countries. Across the OECD and especially within manufacturing industries, there is compelling evidence of partial pass-through in the short-run- rejecting both PCP and LCP. Over the long run, PCP is more prevalent for many types of imported goods. Higher inflation and exchange rate volatility are weakly associated with higher pass-through of exchange rates into import prices. However, for OECD countries, the most important determinants of changes in pass-through over time are microeconomic and relate to the industry composition of a country's import bundle.

	",52.0,"It is well established in the international literature that minimum wage increases compress the wages distribution. Firms respond to these higher labour costs by reducing employment, reducing profits, or raising prices. While there are hundreds of studies on the employment effect of the minimum wage, there is less than a handful studies on its profit effects, and only a couple of dozen studies on its price effects. Not only is the literature scanty on the minimum wage price effects, but also it lacks a survey on that. This survey represents an important contribution to the literature because it summarizes and critically compares over twenty price effect studies, providing a benchmark in the literature. This survey further contributes to the literature by offering an input to the recent debate over the direction of employment effects of the minimum wage. With employment and profits not significantly affected, higher prices is an obvious response to a minimum wage increase. Moreover, this survey also contributes to the literature by extending the current understanding on the minimum wage as a policy against inequality and poverty. If the minimum wage does not cause disemployment but causes inflation, it might hurt rather than aid the poor, who disproportionately suffer from inflation.

	",8.0,"Two system-based views exist regarding managerial value chain analysis: Theory of Constraints (TOC) and Activity-Based Costing (ABC). There has been considerable debate whether TOC or ABC is the more optimal approach for strategic planning. This study seeks to compare TOC and ABC, while keeping constant the level of environmental turbulence each of the approaches encounter. With regard to organizational systems, literature regarding complex adaptive systems supports the idea that bottom-up approaches are more resilient to volatility. Consequently, this study hypothesizes that the bottom-up ABC approach will prove more agile and less limiting than the top-down TOC approach. This study then performs two computational experiments. The first experiment reveals that the ABC approach generated more PROFIT than the TOC approach, while the TOC produced a larger amount of REVENUE, for all instances of the simulation. The second experiment reveals that a hybrid TOC+ABC approach is the most optimal in the midst of environmental turbulence out of four possibilities. This hybrid TOC+ABC selects a first cut of orders that will generate the highest REVENUES per the TOC approach, and then selects a second cut of orders that will have the lowest COSTS and thus the highest PROFIT per the ABC approach. These results challenge the established literature espousing the TOC approach alone.

	",42.0,"This article suggests that the current public debate that pits security and privacy as dichotomous rivals to be traded one for another in a zero-sum game is based on a general misunderstanding and apprehension of technology on the one hand and a mythology of privacy that conflates secrecy with autonomy on the other.   Further, political strategies premised on outlawing particular technologies or techniques or seeking to constrain technology through laws alone are second-best - and ultimately futile - strategies that will result in little security and brittle privacy protection.    
This article argues that civil liberties can best be protected by employing value sensitive technology development strategies in conjunction with policy implementations, not by opposing technological developments or seeking to control the use of particular technologies or techniques after the fact through law alone.  Value sensitive development strategies that take privacy concerns into account during design and development can build in technical features that can enable existing legal control mechanisms and related due process procedures for the protection of civil liberties to function.    
This article examines how identification, data aggregation and data analysis (including data mining), and collection technologies intersect with security and privacy interests and suggests certain technical features and strategies premised on separating knowledge of behavior from knowledge of identity based on the anonymization of data (for data sharing, matching and analysis technologies) and the pseudonymization of identity  (for identification and collection technologies). Technical requirements to support such strategies include rule-based processing, selective revelation, and strong credential and audit.

	",,"Recent claims have been made that police have obtained ""false"" confessions from innocent persons and that these false confessions have even led to the conviction of innocent persons. This article scrutinizes these claims, examining in detail a number of alleged false confessions collected in a recent paper by Professors Richard Leo and Richard Ofshe. After close examination of trial court records and other similar sources, the article concludes that these allegedly false confessions were in all likelihood actually true confessions given by guilty criminals.   
The article concludes by exploring the lessons that might be drawn from the high proportion of guilty criminals in the collection of ""innocent"" false confessors. Academic research on miscarriages of justice should not rely on mass media descriptions of the evidence against criminal defendants. The media too often slants its coverage in the direction of discovering ""news"" by finding that an innocent person has been wrongfully convicted. Moreover, reliance on second-hand media accounts overgeneralizes the false confession problem, obscuring the fact that the false confession problem is apparently concentrated among a narrow and vulnerable population: the mentally retarded.

	",,"The basic economic goal of copyright law is to balance an author's incentive to create with his or her ability to build on prior work in order to maximize social wealth. This balance is extremely important for computer software. On the one hand, software is often expensive to create and companies therefore need protection in order to recoup their investment. On the other hand, software is often expensive to create and companies can save costs by reusing pre-existing work. Quite often, the same companies that want to protect their software also want to use pre-existing work.    
As a result of the competing costs and benefits of copyright protection and the general complexity of computer software, the state of copyright law with respect to computer software has been in flux since the early 1980's and is still not settled. It appears that federal courts have been able to determine efficient economic outcomes based on the cases before them, but they have been unable to settle on a rule that definitively determines how much reuse to allow in each case.    
How should a court go about deciding when reuse should and should not be allowed? While case law and traditional economic analysis provide general solutions, they do not guide courts in specific cases. This paper analyzes the problem that courts face in computer software copyright cases, presents an economic model that describes this problem, and presents a set of economic based factors that can be used by courts to obtain efficient solutions in each case.

	",,"In The Bell Curve Herrnstein and Murray argue that a youth's intelligence (IQ) is a more important determinant of social and economic success in adulthood than is the socioeconomic status (SES) of his or her parents.  Herrnstein and Murray base this conclusion on comparison of effects of IQ score (measured at ages 15 and 23) and the effects of an index of parents' SES from models of economic status, marriage, welfare use, involvement in crime, as well as several outcomes for young children. Reviewers of The Bell Curve have questioned whether Herrnstein and Murray's estimates of the effects of IQ are overstated by their use of a rather crude measure of parents' SES. Comparisons of siblings in the Herrnstein and Murray sample, a more complete and accurate way to control for family background, reveal little evidence that Herrnstein and Murray's estimates of the effects of IQ score are biased by omitted family background characteristics (with the possible exception of outcomes for young children). However, there is evidence of substantial bias due to measurement error in their estimates of the effects of parents' socioeconomic status. In addition, Herrnstein and Murray's measure of parental SES fails to capture the effects of important elements of family background (such as single-parent family structure at age 14).  As a result, their analysis gives an exaggerated impression of the importance of IQ relative to parents' SES, and relative to family background more generally. Estimates based on a variety of methods, including analyses of siblings, suggest that parental family background is at least as important, and may be more important than IQ in determining socioeconomic success in adulthood.

The Article studies the history of the motion picture industry's pricing systems in their legal, economic, and technological contexts. It shows that, despite intensive antitrust scrutiny and litigation, forces with considerable market power have almost always shaped the industry's pricing systems. Uniform pricing, it is argued, is a consequence of the industry's history, structure, and governing legal rules.  In particular, the Article argues that the uniform pricing regime has been maintained by the same forces that have always controlled the market.  The Article explores the justifications for the uniform pricing regime and concludes that the vertical restraints that perpetuate this regime are the industry's response to the broad 1948 Paramount prohibitions on vertical restraints. The enforcement of uniform pricing is generally less observable than the enforcement of other forms of vertical restraints and has never been challenged by the government or private parties. More generally, the Article illustrates how inefficient pricing systems may form, evolve, and survive in the shadow of antitrust law, even in a high-profile industry such as the motion picture industry.

	",51.0,"This paper presents results from an in-depth analysis of the foreign exchange rate exposure of a large nonfinancial firm based on proprietary internal data including cash flows, derivatives and foreign currency debt, as well as external capital market data. While the operations of the multinational firm have significant exposure to foreign exchange rate risk due to foreign currency-based activities and international competition, corporate hedging mitigates this gross exposure. The analysis illustrates that the insignificance of foreign exchange rate exposures of comprehensive performance measures such as total cash flow can be explained by hedging at the firm level.

	",,"This paper examines the labor market for mutual fund managers and managers' responses to the implicit incentives created by their career concerns.  We find that managerial turnover is sensitie to a fund's recent performance. Consistent with the hypothesis that fund companies are learning about managers' abilities, managerial turnover is more performance-sensitive for younger fund managers.  Interpreting the separation-performance relationship as an incentive scheme, several of our results suggest that a desire to avoid separation may induce managers at different stages of their careers to behave differently.  Younger fund managers appear to be given less discretion in the management of their funds; i.e. they are more likely to lose their jobs if their fund's beta or unsystematic risk level deviates from the mean for their fund's objective group. We also show that the shape of the job separation-performance relationship may provide an incentive for young mutual fund managers to be risk averse in selecting their fund's portfolio. Consistent with these implicit labor market incentives, younger fund managers do take on lower unsystematic risk and deviate less from typical behavior than their older counterparts.  Finally, additional results on the flow of investments into mutual funds suggest that rather than just being due to a screening process, firing decisions may also be influenced by a desire to stimulate inflows of investment into the fund.

The motivation behind this study is the implicit assertion by the SEC, the NYSE and the NASDAQ that earnings management and poor corporate governance mechanisms are positively related.  	  A non-linear negative relation is found between audit committee independence and earnings manipulation. Specifically, a significant relation is found only when the audit committee has less than a majority of independent directors. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the new regulations, no significant association is found between earnings management and the more stringent requirement of 100% audit committee independence.      
Empirical evidence also is provided that other corporate governance characteristics are related to earnings management.  Earnings management is positively related to whether the CEO sits on the board's compensation committee. It is negatively related to the CEO's shareholdings and to whether a large outside shareholder sits on the board's audit committee. These results suggest that boards structured to be more independent of the CEO may be more effective in monitoring the corporate financial accounting process.

	",,"Article II, section 3 of the Constitution provides that the President ""shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."" The practical significance of the first part of the recommendation clause is evident every January, when the President addresses Congress. It also forms the basis for congressional demands for information from the President, which sometimes ignite controversies over executive privilege. But the second part of the recommendation clause, although an obscure provision, has great significance for federal lawmaking.During the Reagan presidency, Congress frequently inserted into appropriations bills specific riders prohibiting the Executive Branch or an independent regulatory agency from advocating or even studying a change in a particular policy. For example, Congress prohibited the Executive from using appropriated monies to study or propose selling the Bonneville Power Administration or the Department of Energy's uranium enrichment facilities, and it prohibited the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from expending any funds to review agricultural marketing orders. On another occasion, without amending the Sherman Act, Congress prohibited the expenditure of appropriated funds on ""any activity, the purpose of which is to overturn or alter the per se prohibition on resale price maintenance in effect under Federal antitrust laws."" The rider, which was enacted after the Department of Justice had filed its amicus brief in , prevented Assistant Attorney General William F. Baxter from advocating in oral argument that the Supreme Court should adopt the rule of reason; the rider also prohibited the Antitrust Division from drafting legislation to extend the rule of reason to resale price maintenance.I call such appropriations riders ""muzzling laws."" More precisely, I define a muzzling law to be any legislation that impairs the Executive's ability to deploy resources to study or advocate a change in the federal government's policies on a particular issue. Muzzling laws lack the predictability of legal boilerplate. They differ in the scope of the forbidden subject matter, in the specificity with which they identify the constrained Executive Branch officers, and in the degree to which they prohibit the use of funds appropriated under other appropriations laws. Despite these differences, all muzzling laws implicate, and many violate, the principle of separation of powers. When Congress prohibits the President from studying or advocating a change in policy, it impairs the President's ability to perform his constitutional duty to inform Congress and make recommendations for its consideration.Part I of this Article examines the meaning of the recommendation clause. Part II argues that limiting principles for the clause cannot arise from Congress' appropriations power. Part III offers an economic rationale that accounts for the prevalence of muzzling laws. Part IV argues that muzzling laws violate the recommendation clause. Part V discusses the applicability of the recommendation clause to independent regulatory agencies. Finally, Part VI speculates about judicial review of a recommendation clause challenge to a muzzling law.

	",,"The position of the current US administration is that moves to reduce consumption of gas (like the Kyoto Treaty), will harm the US economy. On the contrary I show that a tax on crude would transfer wealth of $100+ billion a year from foreign governments to the US consumers, thus providing a major economic stimulus to the economy while at the same time reducing consumption of gas. Over the past decade crude oil prices have increased from $12 (1998) to over $65 a barrel. The amount of net oil exported by importing countries is about 28 million barrels a day. With 1998 prices as a reference, this translates to an additional wealth transfer of $1.32 billion a day, or $480 billion a year. If the supply of oil is inelastic, then an increase in tax by the governments of importing countries would push up oil prices and decrease the wealth transfer. For a range of demand and supply elasticities that I study, the wealth transfer savings for the United States (which has about one-third of global oil imports) should be in the range of $108 to $152 billion a year. The new tax revenues to the US government from tax on imported oil should be $160 billion to $250 billion a year. This money can be returned to the US consumers as a lump sum, thus providing the economic stimulus. The reduction in crude oil consumption ranges from 7.13% to 10.30% while providing a stimulus (defined as additional purchasing power to consumers) to the economy of $95 billion to $133 billion a year.

	",34.0,"This article revisits some issues I raised in a 1999 article on credit rating agencies, which increasingly are the focus of scholars and regulators. I discuss how and why credit rating agencies differ from other financial market gatekeepers, such as underwriters and accountants, and assess several recent policy proposals by considering the extent to which they take into account these differences.      
The credit rating industry has changed radically since 1999. Credit rating agencies are now more profitable than other gatekeepers, face different and potentially more serious conflicts of interest, and are uniquely active in structured finance, particularly collateralized debt obligations, now a multi-trillion dollar market. I argue that these changes are related: Moody's Corp. has a $20 billion market capitalization in part because it earns high operating margins from conflicted transactions and credit derivatives. I describe a new approach to understanding the rationale for creating ""synthetic"" CDOs, whose assets consist of credit default swaps instead of bonds or loans. These transactions pose interesting theoretical challenges to some concepts of market efficiency and arbitrage based on mathematical modeling.    
I also assess the agencies' argument that ratings are merely opinions protected by the First Amendment. In several recent cases, including the Enron litigation, judges have dismissed rating agency defendants on free speech grounds, and the agencies increasingly cite journalist privileges in opposing government subpoenas and proposed legislation that would subject them to securities law-type registration requirements. I critique the agencies' free speech claims, but find they are consistent with the agencies' past success in obtaining exemptions from securities law requirements such as Section 11 and Regulation FD.

By allowing a consumer to retain their number when moving between local telephone providers, LNP reduces customers' switching costs and makes it easier for new providers to compete for customers. But regulators face a number of important choices when implementing LNP - what technology should be chosen, what are the costs of implementing LNP and who should pay? This paper considers how the regulator can implement LNP when there is asymmetric information about the optimal timing, choice and cost of technology and about the value of LNP to individual customers. We show that requiring each carrier to bear their own costs and creating transferable ownership of telephone numbers may allow the regulator to overcome the problems created by asymmetric information.

	",31.0,"Using a unique and comprehensive dataset, this paper develops and uses three distinct methods to quantify the risk of a systemic failure in the global banking system. We examine a sample of 334 banks (representing 80% of global bank equity) in 28 countries around 5 global financial crises (such as the Asian and Russian crises), and show that these crises did not create large probabilities of global financial system failure.  First, we show that cumulative negative abnormal returns for the subset of banks not directly exposed to a negative shock (unexposed banks) rarely exceed a few percent. Second, we use structural models to obtain more precise point estimates of the likelihood of systemic failure. These estimates suggest that systemic risk is limited even during major financial crises. For example, maximum likelihood estimation of bank failure probabilities implied by equity prices suggests the Asian crisis induced less than a 1% increase in the probability of systemic failure. Third, we also obtain estimates of systemic risk implied by equity option prices of U.S. and European banks. The largest values are obtained for the Russian crisis, and these show increases in estimated average default probabilities of only around 1-2%. Taken together our results suggest statistically significant, but economically small, increases in systemic risk around even the worst financial crises of the last 10 years. Although policy responses are endogenous, the low estimated probabilities suggest that the distress of central bankers, regulators and politicians about the events we study may be overstated, and that current policy responses to financial crises and the existing institutional framework may be adequate to handle major macroeconomic events.

	",32.0,"This study quantifies the impact of weather on eleven two-digit SIC sectors of the U.S. economy ranging from agriculture and construction to retail trade and utilities. Although it is obvious that weather affects the output of most sectors in some way, the magnitudes of these effects are not well known. This research effort estimates the historical sensitivity of production to annual weather variability. In addition to defining what it means for a sector to be sensitive to weather relative to another sector, industry productivity from 1977-2000 was modeled against measures of temperature and precipitation along with more traditional inputs to production like capital, labor and energy consumption. Specifically, sector output is modeled using a transcendental logarithmic production function (TRANSLOG) with measures of regional weather included. In order to estimate the aggregate sensitivity of the U.S. economy to weather, Monte-Carlo simulation of the four measures of weather is employed for each region by randomly drawing from historically observed weather combinations (i.e., temperature and precipitation) to produce distributions of sector-region output variability holding the conventional economic inputs constant. As expected, the results show that the impact of weather varies from region to region and sector to sector. It is also evident that traditional methods used to model economic production such as the Cobb-Douglas and TRANSLOG specifications are improved statistically with the inclusion of measures of weather as factors of production. Given the available data at the annual level, the econometric results show that in general and across regions, the manufacturing sector is more sensitive to weather (e.g., cooling degree-days) than previously thought. The results also indicate that economic sectors in the Western U.S. are more sensitive to weather than they are in the Midwest and East Coast. It is also reported that as the standard deviation of precipitation changes by 1%, average U.S. transportation and utilities sector output drops between .02% and .09% (respectively). For context, actual year 2000 output for the utilities sector was over $200 billion and actual transportation output exceeded $300 billion at the national level. Similar data is reported for nine additional sectors and four measures of weather across eight regions of the country. Although small with respect to traditional factors of production, it is shown that U.S. GDP has expanded on average by $20.8 billion ($2004 U.S.) annually with measured, historical weather variability. In contrast to the subjective estimates made by Dutton (2003) indicating that ""one-third of private industry activities are sensitive to weather,"" this research finds that only 16.2% of the aggregate U.S. economy is sensitive to weather on an annual basis. Nevertheless, the effects of weather variability on specific sectors, particularly in Western states, is substantial.

	",27.0,"This article discusses how the U.S. court system can function optimally given declining trial rates and the limited resources available.  The question of how much justice we can afford is a challenge that becomes more difficult as budgets fall behind the increasing demand for and cost of court services.  Presumably most analysts would agree that courts should try cases when appropriate - and help litigants find just resolutions without trial when it is not needed.  The courts' ability to provide trials in some cases is possible only if the vast majority of other cases are not tried.      
This article provides background about the federal district courts' workload and financial situation and then identifies courts' goals for satisfying litigants' and society's interests in the courts.  Based in part on input from federal court clerks, this article discusses benefits and problems caused by declining trial rates and analyzes possible strategies for dealing with those problems.  These strategies include ensuring that litigants have a real choice of disputing procedures including trial, routinely collecting and disseminating data on negotiation and settlement, designing court facilities to fit realities of litigation, reforming legal education to reflect the realities of legal practice, making judging more attractive to judges, and expanding courts' roles in promoting local dispute resolution systems.

	",59.0,"This article describes the racial integration of Emory University and the subsequent creation of Pre-Start, an affirmative action program at Emory Law School from 1966 to 1972.  It focuses on the initiative of the Dean of Emory Law School at the time, Ben F. Johnson, Jr. (1914-2006).  Johnson played a number of leadership roles throughout his life, including successfully arguing a case before the United States Supreme Court while he was an Assistant Attorney General of Georgia, promoting legislation to create Atlanta's subway system as a state senator, and representing Emory in its lawsuit to strike down the state statute that would have rescinded its tax exemption if it admitted African American students (Emory v. Nash, 218 Ga. 317 (Ga. 1962)).  This account supplements my related article on Pre-Start, ""'A Bulwark against Anarchy': Affirmative Action, Emory Law School, and Southern Self-Help"" (SSRN abstract 1007006), providing more information about historical context generally, and particularly about Emory v. Nash.  Johnson was ambitious for Emory as a whole, and particularly for the Law School, and he saw in segregation the single largest impediment to making Emory a nationally prominent research university.  The story of Emory's integration, and Johnson's leadership, requires revision of the prevailing story of integration generally, and especially of universities.  Integration at Emory came about because of the pressure that African Americans and their supporters created through the civil rights movement, but Emory administrators responded to such pressure more constructively than most (e.g., Universities of Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Vanderbilt).  Their actions provide an interesting case study in effective leadership during a period of significant moral and political conflict.

	",12.0,"Over the last year it has been unexceptional to watch the consumer coverage of problems related to the natural disasters created by the hurricanes. Outside of the Southern states, the national media and leaders of other consumer organizations spent a very large amount of time warning the immediate victims of the storm about construction scammers and con artists; and warning the wider public about flood-damaged cars and charity frauds. But compared to some other real, authentically grave consumer problems connected with the hurricanes, these are neither the only, nor the dominant narratives that leaders of the consumer movement should be focusing on. Many of the institutional leaders of the movement have concentrated on fringe bad actors - at a time when there are problems of greater cumulative significance exploding out of mainstream commercial behavior.By criterion that I think most would consider important - the aggregate impact of the practice in question on general consumer welfare and the aggregate impact on consumers' loss of home, health, employment, purchasing power and leisure time enjoyment - the serious consumer problems connected with natural disasters relate not to charity scams and fly-by-night construction companies, but to the insufficiently compassionate responses of mortgagees, banks, credit card issuers, and utilities. With only a few exceptions, however, the behavior of major commercial actors, especially in the financial sector has not been comprehensively illuminated. This discussion examines the mainstream housing, banking, lending, and selected basic utilities sectors to learn more about the increased costs and burdens that commercial entities have imposed on consumers, in the aftermath of the hurricanes, and more generally to reveal the unique possibilities for public education and reform which arise during times of natural disaster.

We show that after controlling for firm size, board composition, a measure of management's commitment to transparency (the existence of an ethics program) and institutional ownership, the percentage of audit committee members having expertise in accounting or financial management is positively related to financial reporting quality. We also find some evidence of a positive relationship between the size of the audit committee and financial reporting quality. However, audit committee independence is not related to financial reporting quality. We also verify that our results are robust across different measures of financial reporting quality. Our results suggest that mandating greater expertise on audit committees rather than simply requiring one expert on the audit committee may be beneficial to investors. In addition, our results also provide weak support for the recommendation of the Blue Ribbon Committee that firms devote significant directorial resources to the audit committee. Given the prior evidence of a negative relationship between financial reporting quality and cost of capital, firms could improve their reporting quality by appropriately structuring their audit committees, thus reducing their cost of capital.

	",35.0,"This article considers the relationship between the National Labor Relations Act and Coase's Theorem.  It concludes that the Coase Theorem cannot be used to justify and explain interpretations of the National Labor Relations Act.  In particular, the article argues that the Coase Theorem cannot explain the rule derived from NLRB v. Mackay Radio Corporation permitting employers to permanently replace striking workers without violating the NLRA.    
The article uses internal labor markets theory to reconsider a prominent Coasean analysis of the Mackay Radio doctrine.  This article disagrees with that analysis' conclusion that Mackay Radio established an efficiency-enhancing rule of law.  Since the Mackay Radio doctrine is an important and influential rule of American labor law, the Coase Theorem's inability to explain and justify the doctrine weakens its claim to relevance in NLRA interpretations.      
This article also takes a broader approach to the relationship between the NLRA and the Coase Theorem building on new research from noted Princeton labor economist Alan Krueger and Alexandre Mas.  Krueger and Mas established an association between Bridgestone/Firestone's hiring of permanent  replacement workers during a 1995 strike at its Decatur, Illinois facility and the production of defective tires (principally tires used on Ford Explorers) that have hurt and killed consumers.  This article argues that ""secondary externalities"" like the harm caused to Bridgestone/Firestone's customers must be included in any Coasean efficiency calculation. Taking secondary externalities into account, however, will frequently and necessarily result in the Coase Theorem's efficiency goal conflicting with the NLRA's command that employers and unions, not judges or the National Labor Relations Board, determine the substance of collective bargaining agreements.  So, in this more fundamental sense, the Coase Theorem and the NLRA are incompatible.

	",8.0,"The standard trope in the literature on retributive theory is that mercy serves as an unwelcome interruption of the narrative between crime and punishment.  Underlying this theme is the purportedly retributivist notion that the criminal law and its institutions should impose some form of divine or poetic justice for wrongdoing of all different kinds.  On this view, the exercise of mercy works a simple failure of justice.  But once retribution is better understood - not as revenge or retaliation but as a complex institutional practice arising from and enforcing liberal legal norms of democratic pedigree - its relationship to mercy requires reexamination. That reexamination reveals previously unanticipated problems about the difficulties associated with democratically authorized sites for mercy.  The unsettling dimensions of this tension have not been sufficiently appreciated by previous retributivist critiques.  Importantly, the retributivist case against mercy still endures - not because mercy is a failure of justice (qua just deserts), but because it is a failure of equality.  This realization suggests robust and surprising implications for the responsible design of attractive criminal justice institutions.

It attempts to cut across the traditional line of value and growth measures by analyzing the performance of favored and less attractive stocks within an industry (a relative rather than absolute value approach). The findings indicate that there is a regular mispricing of growth and value stocks within industries themselves. There is also evidence that relative value accounts for some variation in returns that absolute value does not. The results shown are consistent with mispricing, which is difficult to reconcile with risk-based explanations of contrarian effects.

	",,"The U.S. News & World Report annual rankings play a key role in ordering the market for legal education, and, by extension, the market for entry level lawyers. This Article explores the impact and evolution of placement and post-graduation data, which are important input variables that comprise 20 percent of the total rankings methodology.  In general, we observe clear evidence that law schools are seeking to maximize each placement and post-graduation input variable.  During the 1997 to 2006 time period, law schools in all four tiers posted large average gains in employment rates upon graduation and nine months, which appear to result from a combination of competition and gaming strategies. In addition, Law schools in tiers 2, 3, and 4 have increased 1L academic attrition, which may be an attempt to increase the U.S. News bar passage score.   
We also use multivariate regression analysis to model the employed at graduation and employed at nine months input variables.  We find that the following factors are associated with higher employed at graduation rates: (1) higher 25th percentile LSAT scores, (2) more on-campus interviews (OCI), (3) higher percentage of part-time students, (4) location outside a Top 10 corporate law market, and (5) status as a historically black law school.  All of these factors except LSAT and OCI activity vanish when examining the employed at 9 months data.  The U.S. News Lawyer/Judge reputation score is associated with higher employment at nine months.  Further research on the Lawyer/Judge survey instrument is needed.  
After presenting our empirical results, we critique the specific measures of post-graduation success used in the U.S. News rankings and explain how each can be improved.  We conclude that the best solution to law schools' complaints about the impact of U.S. News rankings is greater data availability and transparency, particularly on post-graduation outcomes and other factors affecting students' eventual employment prospects.

	",6.0,"The Religious Test Clause of the United States Constitution states that ""no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" Although it is the only place in the main text of the Constitution that mentions religion, it has been habitually ignored - until now. In the past several years, a spate of lower federal court nominations and two Supreme Court nominations - the successful nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts and the abortive nomination of Harriet Miers - have occasioned public debate over whether the Religious Test Clause forbids Presidents and/or Senators from supporting, opposing, or even questioning nominees on the basis of religion. More broadly, these events have been the occasion for discussions about whether and how religion may be raised in the public debate surrounding judicial nominees. Because the Roberts and Miers nominations present neat mirror images of each other, with religion used as a disqualification in one nomination and a qualification in the other, it is an opportune moment to assess what the Religious Test Clause has to say about these cases, and about the use of religion in the federal judicial nomination process more generally.      
This article, a contribution to a Symposium on ""Religion, Division, and the Constitution,"" is the first to fully examine these questions. After discussing the invocation of the Religious Test Clause in the recent nomination controversies, it looks carefully at the text and history of the Religious Test Clause. It argues that the Religious Test Clause precludes Congress or the President from imposing a formal test oath on would-be federal office-holders that would require them to avow or disavow, under oath, allegiance to a particular faith or set of religious doctrines. And that is all it does. A President may select nominees on the basis of their faith if he chooses; a Senator may question a nominee on his or her faith or religiously derived beliefs, or support or oppose a nominee on that basis. Thus, those public officials, public figures, and commentators who argued during the recent nomination process that the Religious Test Clause barred certain actions or inquiries were wrong.    
I argue that this conclusion is not only descriptively accurate; it is also normatively sound. There are many plausible reasons why a President or Senator might validly inquire into the faith, or religiously derived beliefs, of a nominee. To silence such inquiries because of the dangers of intermixing religion and politics ultimately disserves the broader principle that religion ought to be a fully welcome part of discussion in the public sphere. In addition, the broad reading of the Religious Test Clause, by constitutionalizing an area of politics, unduly limits the scope of popular responsibility for the political process. The best remedy for abuses of religion in the judicial nomination process lies in the realm of ordinary politics, and not in the Constitution.    
Although the Constitution thus provides few if any barriers to the use and abuse of religion and religious rhetoric in the federal judicial nomination process, nothing prevents us from attempting to craft evaluative criteria that might lead to more fruitful uses of religion in public debate, and to guide our understanding of how well or poorly religion has been used in the public debate surrounding judicial nominations. The article thus offers several principles of ""constitutional etiquette"" that might guide our understanding of the sound use of religion in this context, and measures the recent nomination controversies against these standards. It concludes that even with these criteria in place, the invocation of religion in judicial nominations, as elsewhere, may lead to more rather than less division in our national politics. But the price is well worth paying, if our public discussions become richer and deeper as a result.

	",79.0,"The first vacancies on the Supreme Court in eleven years have sparked renewed debate about the continued viability of life tenure for federal judges. Scholars have decried life tenure as one of the Framers' worst blunders, pointing to issues such as strategic retirement, longer average tenure, and widespread mental infirmity of justices. In this Article, the authors argue that, notwithstanding the serious problem of mental and physical infirmity on the Court, life tenure should be retained. They also argue that recent statutory proposals to eliminate or undermine life tenure, for example through a mandatory retirement age or term limits, are unconstitutional.    
Surprisingly, scholars have failed to take a multidisciplinary approach to the question of life tenure, or to propose alternatives that address its weaknesses without abolishing it. The authors address that gap by adopting an incentives approach to Supreme Court retirement. They first demonstrate that, as an historical and empirical matter, pensions have been the most important factor in influencing the retirement timing of Supreme Court justices and comparable actors over history. Building on that track record, the authors propose that Congress create a golden parachute for Supreme Court justices by doubling their retirement benefits upon reaching an appropriate retirement age or upon certifying a mental or physical disability. They also propose modest institutional reforms that will make the office of senior justice more attractive to justices considering retirement.

A common methodology and the stability of monetary relationships produced similar conclusions about money.

	",41.0,"We analyze the relationship between incumbency and innovative activity in the context of a model of technological competition in which successful entrants are able to license their innovation to (or be acquired by) an incumbent. That such a sale ought to take place is natural since the post-innovation monopoly profits are greater than the sum of duopoly profits. The possibility of licensing leads to four key results. First, the unique equilibrium involves a technologically successful entrant licensing their innovation to the incumbent rather than entering the product market. Second, when intellectual property rights are weak, incumbents invest in R&D to achieve a strong bargaining position with technologically successful entrants. Third, incumbents research more intensively than entrants as long as (and only if) their ""willingness-to-pay"" for the innovation exceeds that of the entrant. Relative research intensity is unrelated to the pre-emption motives that were the primary concern of the previous literature. Finally, while the entrant always increases its research intensity in response to an increase in the incumbent's research intensity (strategic complementarity), the incumbent's response to an increase in entrant R&D depends on whether incremental rival research represents a positive or negative externality; when the incumbent's payoffs increase in the level of entrant R&D (as would occur when the licensing fee is relatively low), the incumbent considers entrant R&D an imperfect substitute for in-house research (resulting in strategic substitutability).

	",124.0,"This Article investigates law's constitutive rhetoric about rural people, places, and livelihoods.  Specifically, it considers five categories of judicial opinions that discuss the legal relevance of rurality: judicial self-identification as rural; definitions of rural; line-drawing between rural and urban; taking judicial notice of rural characteristics; and idealized portrayals of the rural.  Viewed together, these clusters of opinions reveal a comprehensive - if not entirely coherent - judicial portrait of rurality.  They also provide an overview of the many instances when a rural setting is relevant to a legal outcome.  Implicated are issues of tort, property, criminal, and constitutional law, among others.       This collection of judicial narratives reveals that law's portrait of rurality has been greatly influenced by popular perceptions of the rural that persist in our national consciousness, including nostalgia for our rural past.  Such nostalgia is reflected in judicial assumptions that rural areas are safe and that rural people are neighborly.  It is also evident in idyll-ising rhetoric about rural land.  In addition, the long-standing notion that law should play less of a role in rural livelihoods persists, apparently based on assumptions that rural people are self-sufficient, rural communities self-contained.       The cases surveyed illustrate not only how legal rhetoric constitutes, maintains, and transforms the rural, but also how this rhetoric demonstrably influences outcomes.  With respect to some issues, law's rhetoric - and therefore law itself - lags behind reality, due in part to out-dated assumptions about rural communities.  Other legal rules have evolved to reflect rural realities, changed as they are in recent years.  While this Article lauds courts for the attention they have paid to the dimension of place in legal analysis, it nevertheless argues that judges should be more careful not to rely on stereotypes in making and applying legal rules. Judges should pay closer attention to rural realities, including the differences among the many places and people they label ""rural.""

	",50.0,"A quarter century ago, Margaret Jane Radin interrupted the hegemonic law and economic discourse on property with a theory of personhood. And the New Jersey Supreme Court declared in the historic case of State v. Shack that property rights serve human values. From these our modern social relations theory of property was born. Now, the pundits declare that intellectual property has come of age. But is intellectual property philosophically and theoretically mature enough to face the world? Unlike its cousins property law and the First Amendment, which bear the weight of values such as autonomy, culture, equality, and democracy, in the United States intellectual property is understood almost exclusively as about incentives. To put it bluntly, there are no giant-sized intellectual property values. But there should be.      
Intellectual property has grown, perhaps exponentially, but its march into all corners of our lives and to the most destitute corners of the world has paradoxically exposed the fragility of its economic foundations while amplifying its social and cultural effects. Indeed, with full compliance to the TRIPS Agreement now required in all but the world's very least developed countries, bringing with it patents in everything from seeds to drugs, intellectual property law becomes literally an issue of life or death. Despite these real world changes, intellectual property scholars increasingly explain their field through the lens of economics alone, evidence of Amartya Sen's observation that theories have lives of their own, quite defiantly of the phenomenal world that can be actually observed.    
The theory is behind the practice. On the ground, underground, and in the ether, intellectual property is spurring what the New York Times calls the first new social movement of the century. I show that in case after case, from MGM v. Grokster, to new licenses from the Creative Commons for developing nations and cultural heritage, to the rise of Internet auteurs of fan fiction, mash-ups, and machinima, to efforts to deliver medicines to the world's poor, to demands for Geographical Indications for sarees and other crafts of the developing world, and to the nascent global movement for Access to Knowledge, traditional economic analysis fails to capture fully the struggles at the heart of local/global intellectual property law conflicts. This Article builds from these examples to lay a foundation for a cultural analysis of intellectual property. I offer IP3 as a metonym. The twentieth century closed with the rise of identity politics, the Internet Protocol, and intellectual property rights. I suggest that the convergence of these IPs begins to explain the growth of intellectual property rights where traditional justifications for intellectual property do not. IP3 reveals intellectual property's social effects and this law as a tool for crafting cultural relations. Call it the ripping, mixing, and burning of law.

	",9.0,"Since September 11, 2001, the Bush administration has repeatedly invoked the state secrets privilege in cases challenging executive conduct in the war on terror, arguing that the very subject matter of these cases must be kept secret to protect national security. The executive's recent assertion of the privilege is unusual, in that it is seeking dismissal, pre-discovery, of all challenges to the legality of specific executive branch programs, rather than asking for limits on discovery in individual cases. This essay contends that the executive's assertion of the privilege is therefore akin to a claim that the courts lack jurisdiction to hear and decide such cases.  
The executive's recent invocation of the privilege raises a concern that has been largely overlooked thus far - the impact of the privilege on legislative power to assign jurisdiction to the federal courts. The U.S. Constitution grants to Congress, and not the President, near-plenary authority to craft federal jurisdiction. Furthermore, when Congress assigns federal courts to hear cases challenging the legality of executive action, it is enlisting the judiciary as its partner in policing executive conduct. The executive's recent use of the privilege disrupts that constitutional collaboration, leaving the executive potentially unchecked by any branch of government. The Essay then discusses how courts should incorporate the concern for legislative power and executive oversight into its analysis of the state secrets privilege. It concludes by suggesting that courts refuse to dismiss these cases until Congress has indicated a willingness to take back the task of executive oversight that it had delegated to the courts through the original jurisdictional grant.

	",128.0,"This is the first article that undertakes a systematic legal analysis of the issue of liability for harm from sample prescription drugs. I propose in this Article that people who suffer injuries resulting from the absence of warnings on samples of prescription drugs be permitted to sue drug manufacturers directly in tort, the learned intermediary rule notwithstanding. I show that the various rationales for the learned intermediary doctrine do not apply to sample prescription drugs. I use empirical studies to show that the drug companies' promotion, marketing, and packaging of sample prescription drugs put patients at risk and tort law should require these companies to absorb those risks when they result in foreseeable harm. Recognition of an exception to the learned intermediary rule in the case of prescription drug samples would spread the risk of harm from unlabeled prescription drugs between physicians and the drug companies in a way that more accurately accounts for their responsibility for that risk. Moreover, recent pronouncements by the federal Food and Drug Administration concerning the preemptive effect of its drug labeling regulations should not affect this analysis.  The FDA's failure to require patient labeling on sample medication is not based on carefully considered scientific evidence. Imposing state tort liability on pharmaceutical manufacturers for failure to warn on samples of prescription drugs would not conflict with any of the FDA's regulatory purposes or goals.

	",14.0,"A thorough examination of the much ballyhooed Sarbanes-Oxley Act reveals dominantly a federal codification of extant rules, regulations, practices, and norms.  Despite advertising it as  ""the most far-reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of FDR,"" a soberly apolitical view sees the Act as more sweep than reform.  Important are provisions calling for nine studies; redundant but much publicized were the certification requirements imposed during the summer of 2002; other moves are mere patchwork responses to precise transgressions present in the popularized scandals. The Act is far from trivial, however. A silver bullet relates to the structure and funding of those who set the standards for auditing and accounting in the United States.  Stripped of power is the AICPA, and altered in funding structure is the FASB.    
All parties but Congress are singled out for a wrist-slapping (auditors, accountants, officers, directors and committee members, lawyers, securities analysts, credit rating agencies, investment banks and financial advisors, state corporate lawmakers, the SEC, the Federal Sentencing Commission and even the Supreme Court).  No reexamanation of Congressional reforms relating to private securities litigation or the erstwhile barrier between investment and commercial banking appear.  In fact there is implicit endorsement of the Congressional approach, rooted in the process and control philosophy of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which the Act follows.  This reading of the Act as modest is advanced in three stages of this Article.  The first   sets the background by summarizing the salient features of the dominant precipitating scandals and their times.  The second stage dissects every material provision of the Act in context. The third and final stage suggests why the political rhetoric and substance diverged so widely, with illustrations of what a substantively bold Act might have looked like.    
Explaining the Act's rhetoric-reality yawn requires speculation but informed hunches readily emerge.  On the one hand, Congress may have understood that the visible debacles were not chronic epidemics but discrete pathologies and their root causes were market psychology beyond its regulatory reach (hence a reformless Act).  On the other, Congress knew that the public perceived an acute systemic crisis of power abuse they had no responsibility for creating (hence the ""sweeping"" rhetoric). Another explanation, which also explains the Act's call for so many studies, is that it is too soon to diagnose deep causes or broad shortcomings but that immediate action was politically expedient.  The studies bridge the gap between action and knowledge, constituting continuing threats to their targets to abide by the spirit of the Act, a threat to make the ""sweeping"" rhetoric real ""reform.""

In steady states more mobile societies have less inequality, but in the short run higher mobility may result from an increase in inequality. Starting from the same inequality, mobility is higher under public than under private education. A rise in income shocks, for example due to increased returns to ability, or a switch from public to private schooling both increase inequality. However, increased shocks raise mobility in the short run and do not affect it in the long run, whereas an increased role for private schooling reduces mobility in both the short and long run. That these differences may help to identify the source of changes in inequality, and other real-world implications, are illustrated in a brief discussion of time trends and cross-country differences.

	",8.0,"Creative Commons is a non-profit U.S. based organization that operates a licensing platform to promote free use of creative works. The idea is to facilitate the release of creative works under generous license terms that would make works available for sharing and reuse. Creative Commons advocates the use of copyrights in a rather subversive way that would ultimately change their meaning.     The paper expresses a skeptical view of this worthy pursuit. While I share Creative Commons' concern with copyright fundamentalism, which inevitably leads to the propertization of everything of value, I am more skeptical of its strategy. The paper explores the legal strategy of Creative Commons and analyzes its potential for enhancing the sharing, distribution and (re)use of creative works.     
Creative Commons as a social movement creates a platform for a wide range of ideologies that share an interest in enhancing access to works. This turns out to be a great advantage for a social movement that is seeking to gain a wider public support. Creative Commons' legal strategy reflects the lowest common denominator:  empowering owners to govern their creative works. At the same time, however, Creative Commons lacks a comprehensive vision of the information society and a shared definition of the prerequisites for open access to creative works. The end result is ideological fuzziness.     
The paper examines the strategic choice of Creative Commons to rely on property rights in its effort to subvert the meaning of copyright. The analysis shows that reliance on property rights, in the absence of a shared sense of free access, may simply strengthen the proprietary regime in creative works. It may reinforce the property discourse as a conceptual framework and as a regulatory scheme for governing the use of information.      
The fuzziness of ideology may further lead to the proliferation of contracts.  Creative Commons' strategy presupposes that minimizing external information costs is critical for enhancing access to creative works. The lack of standardization increases, however, the cost of accessing creative works, and may further enhance the chilling effect of copyright law.     
The paper argues that creating an alternative to copyright may require standardization. To become successful, Creative Commons would have to trade the sovereignty of owners for the reduction of transaction cost that would enhance access to creative works.

	",16.0,"The cost of equity is required (besides various other basic data) for many financial applications such as capital budgeting decisions and performance measurements. A common procedure is to use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which involves estimation of an expected risk premium equal to beta times the expected risk premium on the 'market' portfolio, the portfolio containing all assets in the world. Since the market portfolio is not observable a proxy must be used. Typically beta is estimated using a particular index and another (arbitrary) estimate is chosen for the expected market risk premium. The estimates for beta and the expected market risk premium are then multiplied together. It is obvious that this procedure more than likely yields a biased estimate for the cost of equity. So far, the author agrees fully with what has been extensively described by Jan Bartholdy and Paula Peare in their paper entitled 'Estimating Cost of Equity', re . Note: indeed estimating, the cost of equity cannot be calculated perfectly in each and every detail. What has been argued by Bartholdy and Peare cannot be allowed to pass without comment. They rightly criticise CAPM and their observation is correct, it is indeed surprising that CAPM is so widely used in the way it is. The very heart of the author's criticism relates to the discrete interest rates that are in use both within CAPM and by the two step procedure suggested by Bartholdy and Peare. The reasoning is simple: a discrete 'rate' is not a rate. Consequently, most if not all calculations making (risk-)additions to discrete rates do not fit. Outcomes from such artificial calculations are virtually worthless, notably if and when precise answers are necessary. CAPM is proven not valid. Initially, a given risk free discrete interest 'rate' must be translated into the corresponding continuous interest rate, in order to preserve sensible follow-up calculations.  
Beta-values that are provided by commercial beta-providers are the input into dubious numerations and consequently the CAPM-outcome, the officially presented risk included 'rate'-figure, is artificial. The end outcomes are spurious. One has only to push the e-key on any simple pocket-calculator to defeat the entire financial community that is clinging to old traditions. Who is afraid of the e-power? Busy with all kinds of financial tools. Neither effective (not doing right things) nor efficient (not doing things right). Using PPR (Period Percentage Rate, any period, any rate) i.e. Discrete Compound Interest to rank investments is often deceptive. Financial tools - like the old CAPM - using PPR are dangerous since they lead to misallocation of funds and biased performance measures. It all can be done both finally and easily, as is demonstrated in this paper.  
The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 discusses basic notions, followed by a close inspection of the central CAPM-problem in section 2. The solution i.e. the new CAPM relationship representing 'the state of the art' is the main subject of section 3. An exemplary problem in illustration is given in section 4. Finally, section 5 concludes.

	",45.0,"Sub-federal integration is the practice of cities and states promoting and implementing unratified and non-self-executing treaties. This article examines several instances of sub-federal integration in order to demonstrate the importance of treaties to even non-member countries. The existence of sub-federal integration suggests that the existing focus on federal ratification and congressional implementation overlooks an important mechanism through which domestic integration of treaties can occur. Sub-federal integration provides a concrete example of how unratified and non-self-executing treaties can have real, albeit limited, impact on domestic practices.     No consensus exists within international law scholarship about whether and how treaties influence domestic practices and preferences. Norm-based theorists suggest that treaties can slowly change preferences over time through treaty management which includes repeated persuasive interactions as well as technical and financial assistance. This article uses sub-federal integration to propose an addition to norm-based theories by suggesting the mechanisms of treaty management may be extended to non-treaty members like cities and states.     This article also challenges the prediction that sub-federal integration will trigger norm cascades strong enough to change national preferences for federal ratification. While this article suggests sub-federal integration raises the possibility of modest social change, it acknowledges numerous procedural and political barriers to ratification. Instead, it suggests that ratification is just one of many ways to bring international law home.

	",29.0,"In this article, Professor Gormley examines the interplay between the independent counsel and the impeachment mechanism, in the context of the recent scandal involving President Clinton. He concludes that the impeachment-referral provision contained in Section 595(c) of the independent counsel statute--which mandated that the independent counsel submit to Congress any ""substantial and credible evidence"" related to impeachment--obliterated carefully established boundary lines between the executive and legislative branches of government. First, it encouraged the special prosecutor to gather impeachment-related material for Congress (published in the form of the Starr Report), even though the independent counsel was most likely not constitutionally empowered to indict or criminally prosecute a sitting President. Second, the impeachment-referral provision caused the independent counsel to wear two incompatible hats: one as a detached criminal prosecutor, and the other as a pre-impeachment deputy for the House of Representatives, a function at odds with responsible prosecutorial decision-making. Third, the referral provision allowed Congress to evade its own responsibility for initiating impeachment proceedings, thus sidestepping the political accountability that the Framers carefully placed in the House of Representatives with respect to impeaching high government officials.

	",34.0,"Apprendi v. New Jersey and subsequent Supreme Court cases have extended the Sixth Amendment right of jury trial to some, but not all, factual disputes at sentencing. These court decisions require juries to resolve any non-recidivist sentencing fact that increases the ceiling on a defendant's punishment, but do not extend this requirement to facts that decrease a defendant's punishment or that establish mandatory minimums without raising the maximum allowable sentence.  This fails to provide a coherent or sensible constitutional rule for distributing factfinding powers between judge and jury. The reason is that the Supreme Court has inexplicably decided that all facts subject to the Sixth Amendment jury requirement must also be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, as if they were elements of substantive criminal offenses. This tie-in arrangement between the jury right and the reasonable-doubt rule is mistaken, and has caused two serious problems with the Court's Apprendi jurisprudence.  First, it has produced a formalistic jury right that is easily evaded by legislatures and that hinges on an untenable distinction between aggravating and mitigating sentencing facts. The criminal jury's role was traditionally understood as extending to all questions of fact, as opposed to questions of law, but the Supreme Court cannot adopt this approach because it is unwilling to countenance a corresponding expansion in the proof-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirement and the concept of elements. Second, Apprendi's all-too-limited efforts to expand the jury right have propagated an overbroad concept of elements that lacks historical support and brings needless doctrinal complications to judicial efforts to broaden the right of jury trial. This article urges a different approach that uncouples the Court's link between these two constitutional protections. Juries should decide all disputed questions of fact that aggravate or mitigate a defendant's guilt or punishment. But courts should not require these facts to be charged by prosecutors or proved beyond a reasonable doubt whenever they increase a defendant's maximum allowable punishment. This will give meaningful content to the right of jury trial while avoiding the historical and pragmatic problems caused by an expansive theory of elements.

	",,"This article argues that the core of legal ethics curriculum should be decision theory.  That means that legal ethics courses should integrate rational choice theory (in the form of game theory) and limitations on rational choice (in the form of lessons from social psychology) so that the course becomes a study in the nature of judgment.  The point of the curriculum should be to explain what makes good judgment good, and to illustrate risks that might cause lawyers to make errors in judgment.    
To ground these rather abstract points, the article develops them through a case study of a real lawyer.  Her name is Jesselyn Radack.  A graduate of Brown University and the Yale Law School, Ms. Radack worked in the Professional Responsibility Advisory Office of the Department of Justice (PRAO). Ms. Radack claims the Department forced her out of her job in retaliation for giving the Department advice it did not want to hear about its treatment of John Walker Lindh, the so-called ""American Taliban.""  The Department claimed she exercised poor judgment and did a poor job.    
I discuss Ms. Radack's story in detail (and reach conclusions that differ from accounts of the case published to date.)  I then explain how rational choice theory implies conclusions that differ from those Ms. Radack reached, and offer conjectures grounded in social psychology that might explain how someone in Ms. Radack's position might reach conclusions that differ from those implied by rational choice theory.  I conclude with recommendations for integrating decision theory into the legal ethics curriculum.

	",,"After years of inaction, negotiations for international anti-corruption arrangements produced four major conventions in the space of just a few years.  Yet those conventions have had little discernible impact on the incidence of trans-national bribery.  Focusing on the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, this article examines the reasons for both the sudden success of international anti-corruption initiatives and the desultory implementation of the resulting international arrangements.  Adopting a game theoretic heuristic, the article explains how unilateral adoption of anti-bribery legislation by the United States changed the game from a prisoner's dilemma to one that other countries had no incentive to modify.  Using a combination of direct diplomatic pressure and appeals to the citizens of other countries, the United States succeeded in gaining agreement on the OECD Convention.  Yet, in the absence of either change in the payoff structure perceived by other countries or institutionalization of the factors that yielded the OECD agreement, enforcement of the criminal prohibition on overseas bribery required by the Convention has been virtually non-existent.  Drawing on a variety of theories of international law compliance - including those outside the rational choice domain - the article suggests broad strategies for altering the relevant payoffs so as to complete the conversion of the prisoner's dilemma into an assurance game.  In particular, changing the identity of the agent making the payoff calculus for each country holds promise.  The article ends on a more pessimistic note by identifying, in the context of the OECD arrangement, the limits of even optimal institutional design in making international arrangements effective.

	",29.0,"interactive, privacy is a matter of increasing concern. Many surveys have investigated households' privacy attitudes and concerns, revealing a general desire among Internet users to protect their privacy. To complement these questionnaire-based studies, we conducted an experiment in which we compared selfreported privacy preferences of 171 participants with their actual disclosing behavior during an online shopping episode. Our results suggest that current approaches to protect online users' privacy, such as EU data protection regulation or P3P, may face difficulties to do so effectively. This is due to their underlying assumption that people are not only privacy conscious, but will also act accordingly. In our study, most individuals stated that privacy was important to them, with concern centering on the disclosure of different aspects of personal information. However, regardless of their specific privacy concerns, most participants did not live up to their self-reported privacy preferences. As participants were drawn into the sales dialogue with an anthropomorphic 3-D shopping bot, they answered a majority of questions, even if these were highly personal. Moreover, different privacy statements had no effect on the amount of information disclosed; in fact, the mentioning of EU regulation seemed to cause a feeling of 'false security'. The results suggest that people appreciate highly communicative EC environments and forget privacy concerns once they are `inside the Web'.

The 'idea of police' is then applied exploratorily to the results of the Kansas City and Newark Patrol Experiments and for the 'quasi-experimental' dynamics of Brazil's 1997 police strike, demonstrating its explanatory value.

Previous studies on the optimal trading strategy to execute a given order focuses mostly on the static properties of the supply/demand. In this paper, we show that the dynamics of the supply/demand is of critical importance to the optimal execution strategy, especially when trading times are endogenously chosen. Using the limit-order-book market, we develop a simple framework to model the dynamics of supply/demand and its impact on execution cost. We show that the optimal execution strategy involves both discrete and continuous trades, not only continuous trades as previous work suggested. The cost savings from the optimal strategy over the simple continuous strategy can be substantial.  We also show that the predictions about the optimal trading behavior can have interesting implications on the observed behavior of intraday volume, volatility and prices.

The author argues that the definition of publication needs to be amended to explicitly include electronic dissemination because there is strong support for the interpretation that publication cannot result from electronic dissemination.  Publication is still very significant because publication is necessary for a plaintiff to receive statutory damages.  The author's argument is supported by an analysis of the meaning of publication under the 1976 Copyright Act and a critique of the Southern District of New York's analysis of publication in Getaped.com, Inc. v.

	",4.0,"This essay responds to Orin S. Kerr, Searches and Seizures in a Digital World, 119 Harv. L. Rev. 531 (2005), http://ssrn.com/abstract=697541.    
Professor Kerr has published a thorough and careful article on the application of the Fourth Amendment to searches of computers in private hands - a treatment that has previously escaped the attentions of legal academia. Such a treatment is perhaps so overdue that it has been overtaken by two phenomena: first, the emergence of an overriding concern within the United States about terrorism; and second, changes in the way people engage in and store their most private digital communications and artifacts.    
The first phenomenon has foregrounded a challenge by the President to the very notion that certain kinds of searches and seizures may be proscribed or regulated by Congress or the judiciary. The second phenomenon, grounded in the mass public availability of always-on Internet broadband, is leading to the routine entrustment of most private data to the custody of third parties - something orthogonal to a doctrinal framework in which the custodian of matter searched, rather than the person who is the real target of interest of a search, is typically the only one capable of meaningfully asserting Fourth Amendment rights to prevent a search or the use of its fruits.      
Together, these phenomena make the application of the Fourth Amendment to the standard searches of home computers - searches that, to be sure, are still conducted regularly by national and local law enforcement - an interesting exercise that is yet overshadowed by greatly increased government hunger for private information of all sorts, both individual and aggregate, and by rapid developments in networked technology that will be used to satisfy that hunger. Perhaps most important, these factors transform Professor Kerr's view that a search occurs for Fourth Amendment purposes only when its results are exposed to human eyes: such a notion goes from unremarkably unobjectionable - police are permitted to mirror entirely a suspect's hard drive and then are constitutionally limited as they perform searches on the copy - to dangerous to any notion of limited government powers. Professor Kerr appreciates this as a troublesome result - indeed, downright creepy - but does not dwell upon it beyond suggesting that the copying of data might be viewed as a seizure if not a search, at least so long as it involves some physical touching or temporary commandeering of the machine. This view should be amplified: If remote vacuum cleaner approaches are used to record and store potentially all Internet and telephone communications for later searching, with no Fourth Amendment barrier to the initial information-gathering activity in the field, the government will be in a position to perform comprehensive secret surveillance of the public without any structurally enforceable barrier, because it will no longer have to demand information in individual cases from third parties or intrude upon the physical premises or possessions of a search target in order to gather information of interest. The acts of intruding upon a suspect's demesnes or compelling cooperation from a third party are natural triggers for judicial process or public objection. If the government has all necessary information for a search already in its possession, then we rely only upon its self-restraint in choosing the scope and depth of otherwise unmonitorable searching. This is precisely the self-restraint that the Fourth Amendment eschews for intrusive government searches by requiring outside monitoring by disinterested magistrates - or individually exigent circumstances in which such monitoring can be bypassed.     
Taken together, the current areas of expansion of surveillance appear permanent rather than exigent, and sweeping rather than focused, causing the justifications behind special needs exceptions to swamp the baseline protections established for criminal investigations. This expansion stands to remove the structural safeguards designed to forestall the abuse of power by a government that knows our secrets.

	",74.0,"This essay aims to bring two important lines of inquiry and criticism together. It first lays out an institutionally enriched account of what a just world economic order will look like. That account prescribes, via the requisites to that mechanism which most directly instantiate the account, three realms of equal treatment and market completion - the global products, services, and labor markets; the global investment/financial markets; and the global preparticipation opportunity allocation. The essay then suggests how, with minimal if any departure from familiar canons of traditional international legal mandate interpretation, each of the Bretton Woods institutions - particularly the GATT/WTO and the IMF - can be viewed at least in part as charged with the task of fostering equal treatment and ultimate market completion within one of those three realms. The piece then argues that one of the institutions in particular - the World Bank - has, for reasons of at best negligent and at worst willful injustice on the part of influential state actors in the world community, fallen farthest short in pursuit of what should be viewed as its proper mandate. The article accordingly concludes that a fuller empowerment of the Bank to effect its ideal mission will press the Bretton Woods system more nearly into ethical balance, and with it the world into justice; and that full empowerment of the GATT/WTO and IMF should be partly conditioned upon the fuller empowerment of the Bank.

	",39.0,"Journalists, politicians, jurists, and legal academics often describe the privacy problem created by the collection and use of personal information through computer databases and the Internet with the metaphor of Big Brother - the totalitarian government portrayed in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.  Professor Solove argues that this is the wrong metaphor.  The Big Brother metaphor as well as much of the law that protects privacy emerges from a longstanding paradigm for conceptualizing privacy problems.  Under this paradigm, privacy is invaded by uncovering one's hidden world, by surveillance, and by the disclosure of concealed information.  The harm caused by such invasions consists of inhibition, self-censorship, embarrassment, and damage to one's reputation.  Privacy law has developed with this paradigm in mind, and consequently, it has failed to adapt to grapple effectively with the database problem.  Professor Solove argues that the Big Brother metaphor merely reinforces this paradigm and that the problem is better captured by Franz Kafka's The Trial.  Understood with the Kafka metaphor, the problem is the powerlessness, vulnerability, and dehumanization created by the assembly of dossiers of personal information where individuals lack any meaningful form of participation in the collection and use of their information.  Professor Solove illustrates that conceptualizing the problem with the Kafka metaphor has profound implications for the law of information privacy as well as which legal approaches are taken to solve the problem.

Although it is intended to restrict the size of government, the pledge probably hinders rather than helps efforts to restore fiscal responsibility.  Evidence from trends in aggregate taxes and spending, the success or failure of budget rules, and the voting records of pledge signers casts doubt on the view that signing the pledge is an effective effort to starve the beast or an act of fiscal responsibility.  If all of the signers uphold the pledge, it will prove impossible to repeal any part of the 2001, 2002, and 2003 tax cuts before President Bush leaves office, though the legislation could expire as scheduled even if all the signers supported extension.

Village and individual data confirm a decline in fertility of about 15 percent in the program villages compared with the control villages by 1982, as others have noted, which persists until 1996. The consequences of the program on a series of long run family welfare outcomes are then estimated in addition to fertility: women's health, earnings and household assets, use of preventive health inputs, and finally the inter-generational effects on the health and schooling of the woman's children. Within two decades many of these indicators of the welfare of women and their children improve significantly in conjunction with the program-induced decline in fertility and child mortality. This suggests social returns to this reproductive health program in rural South Asia have many facets beyond fertility reduction, which do not appear to dissipate over two decades.

	",13.0,"Market productivity is often greater, and leisure and other household activities more enjoyable, when people perform them simultaneously. Beyond pointing out the positive externalities of synchronicity, economists have not attempted to identify exogenous causes that affect timing. We develop a theory illustrating conditions under which synchronicity will vary and identify three factors - the amount of daylight, the timing of television programming, and the benefits of coordinating work schedules across a large country - that can alter timing. Using the American Time Use Survey for 2003 and 2004, we first show using a natural experiment that abstracts from the impacts of daylight hours and television timing that an exogenous shock to time in one area leads its residents to alter their work schedules to coordinate more closely with people elsewhere. We then show that both television timing and the benefits of coordinating across time zones in the U.S. generally affect the timing of market work and sleep, the two most time-consuming activities people undertake. These impacts do not, however, differ greatly by people's demographic characteristics, suggesting that longitude and television establish social norms that affect everyone.

	",13.0,"This paper reviews the theoretical development of the concept of comparative advantage, starting with the two-good model of Ricardo and the two-good extension and reinterpretation by Haberler. In both, the presence of comparative advantage provides the scope for countries to gain from trade by specializing, and the pattern of that trade is explained by the pattern of comparative advantage. These strong results of the two-good model can be extended under certain circumstances to multiple goods and countries, but under more general assumptions such strong results no longer are assured. Instead one can derive much weaker results, usually in the form of correlations between comparative advantage and trade, and these weaker results hold in a much wider variety of circumstances. The paper examines those assumptions that permit such generalizations, but then also examines when those assumptions are most likely to fail, and what happens as a result.

	",26.0,"Using an optimizing model we derive the optimal monetary and exchange rate policy for a small stochastic open economy with imperfect competition and short run price rigidity. The optimal monetary policy has an exact closed-form solution and is obtained using the utility function of the representative home agent as welfare criterion. The optimal policy depends on the source of stochastic disturbances affecting the economy, much as in the literature pioneered by Poole (1970). Optimal monetary policy reacts to domestic and foreign disturbances. If the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption is less than one, as is likely to be the case empirically, the optimal exchange rate policy implies a dirty float: interest rate shocks from abroad are met partially by adjusting home interest rates, and partially by allowing the exchange rate to move. This optimal pattern may help rationalize the observed fear of floating.

	",,"One of American society's most cherished beliefs is that the workplace is, or should be, asexual. This ethic is a legacy of our historic commitment to a conception of organizational rationality that treats sexuality as irrational and unproductive - a conception that had come under challenge until sexual harassment law gave it a new lease on life. Using a historical and sociological analysis, Professor Schultz shows that the law's focus on eliminating unwanted sexual conduct has provided added incentive and increased legitimacy for a managerial project of suppressing sexuality in the workplace. In the name of preventing sexual harassment, many employers are prohibiting potentially benign forms of sexual conduct, without attending to the larger structures of sex segregation and inequality in which genuine sex harassment flourishes. Employers have begun to impose strict disciplinary measures, costing many people their jobs or reputations and threatening employees' ability to form their own work cultures. Employers also increasingly ban or discourage employee romance, chilling intimacy and solidarity among workers of both a sexual and nonsexual variety. Evidence also suggests that employers sometimes use sexual harassment charges as a pretext for punishing employees for discriminatory or other suspect reasons, and employees are quicker to accuse coworkers of a different race, sexual orientation, or class whose sexuality threatens or offends them.  Worst of all, employers are punishing sexual conduct without examining whether it is linked to sex discrimination in purpose or effect.    
Contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy, Professor Schultz argues, workplace sexuality is not always discriminatory or disruptive: Sexual conduct takes its shape and meaning from the larger organizational context. Sociological research shows that women who work in well-integrated, egalitarian settings often participate and take pleasure in sexual interactions - probably because their numerical strength gives them the power to help shape sexual norms to their own liking. Thus, rather than encouraging employers to desexualize, we should encourage employers to desegregate. To create the incentive to do so, the law should make sex harassment easier to prove in significantly segregated and unequal work settings, and harder to prove in fully integrated and equal ones. At an even more basic level, legal actors and reformers must abandon the traditional definition of harassment as sexual conduct in favor of a broader focus on discriminatory conduct, because the emphasis on sexual conduct as harmful has given the law a cultural tilt that meshes well with the preexisting managerial view of sexuality and motivates managers to extend the law's reach within organizations. By the same token, the fact that managers can justify their actions with reference to a feminist-inspired body of law has facilitated their ability to implement zealous policies that extend the law. Thus, Professor Schultz's account of the development of sexual harassment law teaches that law makes a difference, but the difference it makes depends on how it interacts with larger institutional and cultural forces that will shape it in everyday life. Ultimately, she argues, those who seek to halt sanitization must offer a new vision in which sexuality can coexist with, and even enhance, gender equality and organizational rationality.

	",26.0,"Many studies have shown that women are under-represented in tenured ranks in the sciences.  We evaluate whether gender differences in the likelihood of obtaining a tenure track job, promotion to tenure, and promotion to full professor explain these facts using the 1973-2001 Survey of Doctorate Recipients.  We find that women are less likely to take tenure track positions in science, but the gender gap is entirely explained by fertility decisions.  We find that in science overall, there is no gender difference in promotion to tenure or full professor after controlling for demographic, family, employer and productivity covariates and that in many cases, there is no gender difference in promotion to tenure or full professor even without controlling for covariates.  However, family characteristics have different impacts on women's and men's promotion probabilities.  Single women do better at each stage than single men, although this might be due to selection.  Children make it less likely that women in science will advance up the academic job ladder beyond their early post-doctorate years, while both marriage and children increase men's likelihood of advancing.

	",22.0,"This paper examines certain theoretical constructs in law, legal theory, and communications theory that relate to secondary liability and its applicability to regulating online behavior. The central thesis of this paper is that a theoretical basis for ascribing legal responsibility to third parties can be based on that party's constitutive role in enabling illegal acts of others to produce social harm.  Specifically, that the provision by an Internet service provider (ISP) of access to the enabling technical infrastructure - the network medium - in itself creates a responsibility base for mitigating social harm arising from the use of that infrastructure based on the effects of the mediation in furthering or contributing to the harm.     
The purpose of this paper is to explore certain theoretical constructs in order to develop an analytic framework that is potentially useful in delineating the appropriate scope, and under what circumstances and rationale, legal responsibility can be ascribed to ISPs for the actions of their users.     
Thus, in Part I we examine the theoretical basis for legal responsibility; in Part II, we review the existing doctrines of secondary liability as applied in particular contexts, (copyright, defamation, respondeat superior) in Part III, we suggest a performative standard for assessing ISP liability; in Part IV, we develop a preliminary approach for applying a constitutive standard for third party liability to ISPs; and, in Part V, we set out areas for further development.    
Applying the constitutive paradigm for legal responsibility, ISPs can be ascribed liability for providing access to the network and for their user's misconduct in so far as network access (or other services) give the conduct its effect.  ISPs acquire subject-responsibility by virtue of their role in enabling the condition for user misconduct and object-responsibility for the online status of their user itself.  These dual responsibility relationships provide a responsibility base for the harmful affects of the user's behavior. Additionally, the possession and exercise of the power to control harmful online conduct is itself a basis for assigning responsibility for mitigating the social harm.    
This paper explores third party liability under various theoretical constructs, including a constitutive paradigm for responsibility, existing legal doctrines of secondary liability, and a performative evaluation of effect.  In Part IV we put forward a tentative framework for applying a performative standard for constitutive responsibility on ISPs for user misconduct based on negligence.  However, this paper is not intended to be a definitive statement of these issues, but rather a preliminary research agenda delineating certain areas for further exploration.  Finding or developing legal theories under which to impose responsibility on third parties without creating unwanted incentives for overdeterrence of desirable conduct is a difficult task.

The experimental data show that closeness in the division of preferences induces a significant increase in turnout. Moreover, for closely divided electorates (and only for these electorates) the provision of information significantly raises the participation of subjects supporting the slightly larger team relative to the smaller team. We show that the heterogeneous effect of information on the participation of subjects in different teams is driven by the subjects' (incorrect) beliefs of casting a pivotal vote. Simply put, subjects overestimate the probability of casting a pivotal vote when they belong to the team with a slight majority, and choose the strategy that maximizes their utility based on their inflated probability assessment. Empirical evidence on gubernatorial elections in the U.S. between 1990 and 2005 is consistent with our main experimental result. Namely, we observe that the difference in the actual vote tally between the party leading according to the polls and the other party is larger than the one predicted by the polls only in closely divided electorates.

Nevertheless, when viewed in the aggregate the degree of mobilization achieved during the short period of active US involvement was remarkable.

In 1918 the armed forces were expanded to include 2.9 million sailors, soldiers, and marines; 6 percent of the labor force in the 15 to 44 age bracket. Overall in 1918, one fifth or more of the nation's resources was devoted to the war effort.

	",81.0,"This article tries to justify restrictions on racial and gender stereotypes in advertisements from the perspective of liberal theory. The typical modern advertisement does not present arguments and information. Rather, it presents visual images of desirable life-styles and appeals to the emotional. Stereotype images of gender and race give certain connotations to belonging to a given gender or ethnic group.  In the past several decades the conceptions of many people regarding race and gender have become more egalitarian, but no significant signs of this change can be traced in advertisements. Contemporary advertisements are filled with traditional stereotype images. This gap between advertisements and the principled commitment of many to equality results from the fact that stereotypes are deeply entrenched in the emotional world of many people. By bringing their audiences into repeated contact with stereotypes, advertisements prevent people from internalizing at the emotional level their commitment at the cognitive level to equality. We argue that in order to maintain the autonomy of the audience, restrictions on stereotypes in advertisements should be imposed. The ideal of autonomy demands that individuals will shape their perceptions and beliefs through a rational process. Whereas rationality requires a cognitive process of receiving and processing data, this does not occur in an optimal manner in the context of advertisements. People who are exposed to advertisements are in a state of reduced rationality. Because the messages in advertisements are transmitted indirectly, repetitively, and at a fast pace, the audience cannot contend with them on the cognitive level and is not aware of the changes the advertisement produces in their preferences and opinions.

	",111.0,"This Article examines the No Electronic Theft Act (the Act or the NET Act). The Act represents a significant change to copyright law because it subtly shifts the paradigm underlying criminal copyright infringement. For 100 years, criminal infringement punished infringers who derived a commercial benefit based on someone else's copyrighted work. However, through the Act, Congress adopted a paradigm that criminal copyright infringement is like physical-space theft, specifically shoplifting. As a result, the Act significantly extends the boundaries of criminal copyright infringement.    
Despite the extended criminal boundaries, a review of the post-passage developments suggests that the Act has been unexpectedly ineffective. To fully understand why, this Article focuses on a group of infringers known as warez traders.  While Congress did not specifically reference warez trading in the Act, warez traders were its prime target. Yet, Congress did not fully understand this sociological group or their motivations, resulting in a law poorly tailored to conforming their behavior. But in drafting a broad law to cover warez trading, the Act overstates the harm experienced by copyright owners. This expansive standard for harm covers activities necessary to function in a digital society, unnecessarily turning too many average Americans into criminals. Corrective legislation is required to more precisely distinguish between truly culpable behavior and socially beneficial conduct.

	",16.0,"Many financial applications, such as risk analysis and derivatives pricing, depend on time scaling of risk. A common method for this purpose, though only correct when returns are iid normal, is the square-root-of-time rule where an estimated quantile of a return distribution is scaled to a lower frequency by the square-root of the time horizon. The aim of this paper is to examine time scaling of risk when returns follow a jump diffusion process. It is argued that a jump diffusion is well-suited for the modeling of systemic risk, which is the raison d'etre of the Basel capital adequacy proposals. We demonstrate that the square-root-of-time rule leads to a systematic underestimation of risk, whereby the degree of underestimation worsens with the time horizon, the jump intensity and the confidence level. As a result, even if the square-root-of-time rule has widespread applications in the Basel Accords, it fails to address the objective of the Accords.

	",,"It has become cliche to describe the relationship between security and liberty as one requiring the achievement of some optimal balance between two competing and irreconcilable needs.  But such cliche is metaphorically misleading.  There is no fulcrum point - as is implicit in the balance metaphor - at which point the correct amount of security and liberty can be achieved.  Security and liberty are not dichotomous rivals to be traded one for another in a zero sum game.  Rather, security and liberty are dual obligations of a liberal republic and each must be maximized within the constraints imposed by the other.     
The events and subsequent investigations of 9/11 have highlighted the national security need for better information management, and for new technologies and techniques to improve collection, information sharing, and data analysis in counterterrorism applications.  The need to manage vast data volumes and better ""connect the dots"" is uncontroverted and has been explicitly set out in a series of executive orders, national strategy documents, committee reports, and legislation.     
However, emergent information technologies that can enable such improved information management and analysis processes also challenge traditional policy doctrines and legal structures premised in part on protecting individual liberty by maintaining privacy through the ""practical obscurity"" arising from inefficiencies in information acquisition, access, management, and analysis.  Thus, to some observers, improving the ability of government agencies to ""connect the dots"" is seen to be in political conflict with the notion of keeping the power to ""connect the dots"" out of any one hand, particularly that of the central government.  The result, as evidenced in the public debate, is a presumed implacable antagonism between security and privacy.    
This chapter argues we do not need to resolve this Jacobin discordance in order to design information systems with technical features that can support a broad range of policies to mitigate privacy concerns and still meet security needs.  Indeed, this chapter suggests that there is no inherent technical design conflict at all between security and privacy as the technical features required to support privacy policy are in large part the same technologies required to meet operational information assurance and data security needs in national security or law enforcement information sharing applications.  Both national security and privacy policy require (i) that shared information be useful (that is, that data is accurate, reliable, and timely, and that it can be up-dated or corrected as needed), and (ii) that information be used appropriately according to policy rules.   Technical features to support these concordant policy needs in information systems include rules-based processing, selective disclosure, data quality assurance, error correction, and strong authorization, logging, and audit functions (to control and record for review and oversight purposes what information goes where, under what constraints, and who has access to it).       
This chapter discusses policy-enabling systems design (the Policy Appliance Reference Model) based on an enterprise architecture for knowledge management (a lifecycle approach to managing information from production to consumption as a product to support information process needs) that includes policy appliances (technical control mechanisms to enforce policy rules and ensure accountability in information systems), interacting with smart data (data that carries with it contextual relevant terms for its own use) and intelligent agents (queries that are self-credentialed, authenticating, or contextually adaptive).        
This chapter provides an overview of the relationship between emerging policy process models, existing legal doctrines, and technical design choice in order to better understand the interdependence of technical architecture and policy implementation.

	",68.0,"How do interactions between banks and nonbank financial intermediaries affect economic development, stability, and efficiency? Will banks continue to be relevant in a financial system in which nonbanks take business away from banks, in which the financing of production is less and less important to banking business, and in which e-money is spreading fast? How will the electronic age change banks' role in financial intermediation?    
Over the past two decades, finance theory has contributed significantly to understanding banks and identifying what qualifies them to be special financial intermediaries.    
Historically, banks have had a comparative advantage in certain functions - such as providing liquidity and payment services and supplying credit and information - which competition, technological change, and institutional development have increasingly eroded. And the spread of e-money could deal a blow to conventional banking, generating entirely new ways of doing finance.    
After integrating his examination of money, production, and investment, Bossone argues that banks remain special in that they lend claims on their own debt and the public accepts the debt claims as money.  His study shows that banks and nonbank financial intermediaries perform complementary functions essential to the economy. Risk reduction policies in payment systems, banking asset allocation, and the deposit market affect the economy's tradeoff between risk and efficiency and the cost of generating resources to finance production.    
As possibilities for global communications expand, trust will matter more than ever, and banks and other financial intermediaries will be in a good position to bridge gaps in trust when it comes to creating money and intermediating funds.    
This paper - a product of the Financial Sector Strategy and Policy Department - is part of a larger effort in the department to study the links between financial sector and economic development and improve financial sector policy reforms.

This essay focuses on developments in child custody law stemming from ""Parental Alienation Syndrome"" (PAS), a theory propounded in 1985 by Richard Gardner, M.D. that became widely used despite its lack of scientific foundations.  The discussion highlights theoretical and practical problems with PAS, provides a similar review of more recent proposals labeled ""Parental Alienation"" (PA), and concludes with recommendations for lawyers and judges who must evaluate these and similar developments.

Our derivation of liquidity shocks allows for frequent shifts in velocity as they are derived as structural shocks from VARs in growth rates. Residential property price developments and money growth shocks accumulated over the boom periods are able to well explain the depth of post-boom recessions. We further suggest that liquidity shocks are a driving factor for real estate prices during boom episodes. During normal times however, the relative predictive power of liquidity shocks seems to shift from asset price inflation to consumer price inflation.

	",75.0,"The software industry practice of announcing new products well in advance of actual market availability has led to allegations that firms are intentionally engaging in vaporware. The possible predatory and anti-competitive implications of this behavior recently surfaced in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft Corporation. Taking the perspective that a new product announcement is a strategic signal between firms, we consider the possibility that intentional vaporware is a way to dissuade competitors from developing their own competing new products. An examination of empirical data for the software industry suggests that some firms may use vaporware in a strategic manner. We then formulate and analyze the preannouncement and introduction timing decisions in a game theoretic model of two competing firms. We find that vaporware can be a way for a dominant firm to signal its product development costs, and that intentional vaporware can deter entry. We also show that there is a curvilinear relationship between development costs and announcement accuracy, i.e., firms with high or very low product development costs make accurate product announcements, while firms with intermediate product development costs intentionally engage in vaporware. Empirical support for these theoretical results is also found in the software industry data. Finally, we discuss the beneficial and harmful consequences of vaporware, and the associated implications.

These standards and information have been developed in the single-family mortgage market, but not in the secondary market for rental housing mortgages, which is still in the early stages of development. The advances made in the single-family market were largely due to the leadership provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). This article explores the potential role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the further development of the secondary multifamily mortgage market by examining the LIMAC/Freddie Mac and EMI/Fannie Mae pilot programs. These programs illustrate the challenge of creating industry standards and building an information base and demonstrate that GSEs' participation in this market has been relatively small. Given the public mandate that comes with government sponsorship, we argue that GSEs should take an active leadership role in the development of the multifamily market.

By requiring plaintiffs to demonstrate more directly and concretely that they have been ""injured in fact,"" the recently invigorated rules may force environmental lawyers to think more seriously about how environmental problems actually harm human beings. This more careful consideration could, in turn, significantly assist environmental plaintiffs in building and presenting compelling cases in court and could tranform the approaches they take outside of court to solving environmental problems.

	",65.0,"Prodded by a centralized planning and budgeting process, the U.S. Forest Service's expensive, one-size-fits-all approach to wildfire does not fit the extremely diverse 193 million acres of national forests. The agency's program - which consists of spending close to $300 million per year treating hazardous fuels and as much as $2 billion a year preparing for and suppressing fires - will not restore the national forests to health or end catastrophic fire in most of those forests. In many forests it may do more harm than good.    
Forest Service plans are based on the notion that western national forests suffer from an unnatural accumulation of hazardous fuels. In fact, that is probably true for no more than about 15 percent of those forests. The appropriate treatments on the remaining 85 percent may be as diverse as the forests themselves.    
Significant structural changes in the Forest Service are essential to control fire costs. They should decentralize decisionmaking so local decisions will respond to local economic and ecological conditions.  This paper suggests several possible structural changes.

	",11.0,"A classroom experiment is an effective device to introduce and illustrate new economic concepts. This paper describes the author's experience implementing the classic double oral auction experiment in a high school computer lab, in four classes, with students trading in a virtual market for books, using commercial online software designed for college use. The goal was to run each class through this experiment for five rounds, using a standard lab with no special software, in one class period of 50 minutes. I randomly selected one school experiment, and compared the results with a college class that had done the same experiment, according to three indicators - transactions history, aggregate efficiency, and distribution of excess gain.

	",17.0,"This paper examines the post-War Summer and Winter Olympic Games in order to determine the economic and political determinants of national participation, of female participation in particular, and of success at the Games (i.e., medal counts).  Compared to the Summer Games, Winter participation levels are driven more by income and less by population, have less host nation bias and a greater effect of climate.  Roughly similar factors determine medal count success, although single party and communist regimes win far more medals (and gold medals) in both seasons than can be attributed to other factors.  We find no large significant differences between types of athletic events (e.g. luge versus nordic skiing).  We estimate that major participating nations requires a $260 rise in income per capita to send an extra participant.  Similarly the ""cost"" of an extra medal is $1700 per capita and $4750 per capita for an additional gold medal.  Predictions for participation and medal counts (including gold medals in particular) for the 2002 Salt Lake City Games are presented as a test of our analysis.

Our experiments were conducted in the field in three regions of Colombia. Each group of five subjects played 10 rounds of an open access common pool resource game, and 10 additional rounds under one of five institutions - communication alone, two external regulations that differed by the level of enforcement, and communication combined with each of the two regulations. Our results suggest that the hypothesis of a complementary relationship between communication and external regulation is supported for some combinations of regions and regulations, but cannot be supported in general. We therefore conclude that the determination of whether formal regulations and informal communication are complementary must be made on a community-by-community basis.

As state judicial campaigns become progressively more costly and political, judicial candidates have turned increasingly to lawyers and law firms as a source of campaign funds.  Given that contributing lawyers frequently appear in court, it is natural to wonder whether judges are more likely to rule in favor of attorneys who offered financial support to their campaign.  Looking at cases from the Supreme Court of Georgia's 2003 term, I show that campaign contributions are indeed correlated with judges' decisions.  Further, using a two-stage probit least squares estimator to address questions of causality, I show that the campaign contributions directly affect judicial decision making.

	",21.0,"For decades, Americans have argued about who may marry and what marriage actually means in legal, religious, and philosophical terms. For almost as long, two problems - the rising divorce rate and the poverty of some ""divorced"" children and their custodians - have fed concerns about the viability of marriage as an institution that promotes domestic stability and economic security. This Article explores the notion that domestic partnership based upon business partnership law would better serve more couples, their families, and society as a whole. It proposes a Uniform Domestic Partnership Act, loosely modeled after the UPA, as a substitute for marriage and recommends that marriage continue, without legal significance, under the exclusive control of religious institutions. By demonstrating that modern couples expect civil marriage to provide something different than couples did historically and by adapting business partnership law approaches to areas such as fiduciary duty, agency and transaction costs, and limited liability, this Article proposes a legal structure for domestic enterprises.  Actually, it offers four new solutions: the Filial, the Enduring, the Caregiving, and the Provisional Domestic Partnerships.

Second, I clarify that the Senate has the constitutional power to adjourn a Senate-only special session without the president's permission (Tillman's reply claims that I argued otherwise).

	",,"This article's analysis of the Oslo Accords and their failures reveals important lessons about what in a bilateral peace agreement's text can maximize, and what can diminish, the likelihood that the parties will comply with the agreement's terms.  Reviewing and building upon three key books, the article makes clear that the Oslo process and texts failed to take advantage of many of the most valuable contributions that international law can make to successful peace negotiations.  The failure to take advantage of these tools meant the Accords were, from the beginning, weaker than they could have been.  That congenital weakness was compounded by the parties' heavy reliance on two methodological pillars - open-ended gradualism and constructive ambiguity - that proved to be disastrously counterproductive.       
The logic behind open-ended gradualism was to defer issues that were hard to resolve in the hope that gradually intensifying cooperation between the two sides, and progressively increasing the concessions of each to the other, would build sufficient trust to enable later compromises.  But the Accords' open-endedness as to final status arrangements enabled both sides' leaders to create dangerous expectations by promising their people unattainable results, fed each party's concerns about the other's good faith, deprived both sides' leaders of a vision of the future to sell to their people, left the process hostage to extremists, and encouraged the parties to unilaterally improve their positions on the ground for the final negotiations.    
Gradualism meant almost continual negotiations. These diverted policy analysis resources from permanent-status issues to incremental changes, and created business-sapping uncertainty. Public skepticism was increased by minor interim agreements that seemed to change nothing, friction between the two leaderships was fed by missed deadlines, and changing obligations meant the Accords were unable to benefit from the compliance-promoting efficiencies of routinization.    
The Oslo framers' extensive reliance on constructive ambiguity to paper over differences also seemed to create more problems than it solved. For example, it induced false public expectations as to what had been resolved and fostered dangerous misconceptions as to what had been gained or conceded. Tensions caused by ambiguity in certain areas (such as revision of the Palestinian Charter) wasted valuable negotiating energy and undermined the perceived legitimacy of the agreements as a whole.    
It is impossible to say whether an improved Oslo process and texts would have brought peace. The article notes the strong argument that a successful deal was impossible because Yasser Arafat was from the beginning acting in bad faith, but argues that the possibility of such bad faith does not mean that the only lesson to be learned from Oslo's failure is the danger of signing agreements with the likes of Yasser Arafat.  The article finds that analysis of the flaws of the Oslo agreements is essential for two reasons.  First, the open-ended gradualism and ambiguity of the Accords clearly had a corrosive effect in and of themselves.   Second, any peace deal the Israelis and Palestinians ultimately reach will likely use the Accords as a point of departure.  It is therefore critical to understand which aspects of the Oslo Accords should, on the basis of experience, be disqualified from reappearing irrespective of the leader on the Palestinian side of the deal.    
The article concludes with a discussion of lessons learned, including lessons specifically applicable to future Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and lessons generally applicable to designing peace negotiations, and peace agreement texts, to maximize compliance with their terms.

	",5.0,"Copyright in 1791: An Essay explores the meaning of the Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution as the Founders understood it in their own time. In his examination of the history of copyright prior to the adoption of the Constitution, Professor Joyce and his co-author, L. Ray Patterson of Georgia, consider the language of the Founders' provision for copyright against the background of Anglo-American copyright history from the 16th Century to 1787. Among the authorsâ€™ principal findings is that, to the Founders, a relatively brief term of protection, followed by entry of the work into the public domain, was a crucial element of the copyright grant required to protect against the inherent dangers of a copyright monopoly.In addition, Copyright in 1791 uncovers for the first time the historical interrelationship between the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment. Earlier scholars have sought to reconcile these two constitutional provisions primarily through an analysis of doctrinal considerations, such as the idea/expression dichotomy. The authors conclude that the Founders themselves saw no need for reconciliation: The two provisions already were complementary, both embodying anti-censorship and anti-monopoly values learned by the Founders from their English forebears. As observed by Justice Oâ€™Connor in Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises, â€œFirst Amendment protections [are] embodied in the Copyright Clause.â€ Why? Because in part, as demonstrated by this essay, the Copyright Clause and the Free Press Clause share common origins and authors.

	",53.0,"The thesis of this Article is that outside, foreign, non-native diseases are the most dangerous threat to indigenous populations.  Additional threats include the loss of cultural identity caused by the introduction of new technology, and the loss of religious and cultural identity caused by proselytizing missionaries that seek to replace the indigenous religions.  As such, the world community should take all necessary steps to protect indigenous peoples from these threats.  The best way to prevent the introduction of disease, technology, and foreign culture is to strictly limit any contact between modern-day society and uncontacted indigenous peoples.  While some countries have domestic laws governing the relationship between their citizens  and the uncontacted tribes within their country's boundaries, domestic laws are not enough because of the desire of citizens to exploit natural resources within their geopolitical boundaries.     
Because domestic law is insufficient to protect the indigenous populations, a rule of international law is necessary to ensure compliance in all the countries that have uncontacted indigenous populations.  Current international law does not really address the problems of uncontacted indigenous peoples.  The most pertinent document is the United Nations Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  According to Professor Clinton, the draft Universal Declaration of Indigenous Rights contemplates the continued international legal protection of the peoplehood and political institutions of indigenous and tribal peoples.   While the Declaration has not been ratified by the United Nations member states, the fact that a draft declaration exists is a step in the right direction.    
The Declaration does address a number of issues facing indigenous peoples, but does not address the problem of first contact, that is, initial contact between foreign (usually Western) explorers and indigenous peoples which have had no prior human contact outside the members of their social group.  Thus, I have modified the Declaration to address the issues of first contact, as well as some issues of sovereignty and cultural identity.  The modified Declaration, titled Indigenous Homeland Security: A Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the International Law of First Contact can be found in Appendix A of this paper.

	",,"Modern reproductive technology has been a blessing for many couples unable to conceive naturally. Through procedures such as in vitro fertilization, physicians are able to harvest eggs from the mother, fertilize them outside the womb, and freeze them for later implantation. A scandal at a California fertility clinic, however, illustrated the dangers of this process--namely, the possibility that an egg or embryo produced by one woman might be improperly implanted in the uterus of another, resulting in a legal battle to determine parental rights over the child.    
This article reviews the legal community's response to issues raised by reproductive technology in general and suggests how the law might be adapted to the special case of stolen or misdelivered genetic material. The article finds that traditional parentage laws yield no easy answers because they were crafted in simpler times and cling to the theory that a child can have only one legal mother. The article suggests that a more progressive solution is needed when genetic material is shared without the mother's consent. The article proposes that if both mothers demonstrate an intent to parent the child, the courts should treat them both as legal parents and resolve their competing claims as a custody issue using a modified best interests analysis.

	",,"In 2004, the property-casualty insurance industry was roiled by a scandal unparalleled in its history, with the world's largest insurance broker, Marsh & McLennan, accused of defrauding customers by rigging bids to maximize its own profits.  In addition to its sensational bid-rigging charges, New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's October 2004 suit against Marsh challenged insurers' long-established practice of paying insurance brokers and agents (or producers) additional compensation contingent on their sales volume and the profitability of their risks.  Spitzer argues that such contingent commissions are not adequately disclosed to insurance buyers and can have anticompetitive effects.  Indeed, in Spitzer's view, a broad spectrum of financial arrangements entered into by carriers and independent producers threaten the competitiveness of the P&C insurance market.  But I argue that, rather than promoting competition, an industry-wide ban on contingent compensation might instead undermine the financial stability of small insurance agencies in communities throughout America.  Ironically, this could well lead to the further consolidation of insurance brokerage business in large global firms like Marsh.  Indeed, the state of affairs that first drew Attorney General Spitzer's attention--large commercial insurance brokers allegedly manipulating the market for their own benefit--was the result of nothing so much as the coupling of time-honored sales incentive practices developed on Main Street, USA with an unprecedented level of market power attained by a few global mega-brokers following a consolidation spree in the 1990s.  It would be an expensive mistake, however, to jump from that observation to the conclusion that all contingent compensation of all insurance producers is necessarily harmful to insurance consumers.  This article (i) traces the history of Attorney General Spitzer's investigation into insurance market practices, (ii) offers an overview of producer compensation practices as they have evolved in the U.S. P&C market, (iii) outlines recent regulatory and legislative responses to the Spitzer investigation, and (iv) suggests a simple, voluntary reform that would increase transparency for insurance consumers while avoiding the pitfalls likely to attend more draconian solutions.

In this exchange on the academic field of battle, bluster meets fact in a head-on-clash. This mictuating match has two redeeming features. One is a discussion of the obligation of an academic, in relation to scholarship, to disclose any personal interest such as a retained advocacy relationship. I favor such disclosure; Professor Silver did not.    
In addition, there is a brief discussion of the role of the law professor within the legal profession. Professor Silver advances the view that law professors' self-interest should lead them to hold pro-lawyer views and they should therefore not criticize the legal profession because that contributes to the low public esteem in which the bar is held. I demur. In my view, that low esteem is not due to criticisms of various practices of lawyers and the bar but rather to the failure of the bar to curb abuses and to thus enforce its own standard set forth in the Preamble to the Model Rules of Professional Conduct that the bar should act ""in the public interest and not in furtherance of [its] parochial self-interested concerns. . . .""

The Article discusses the Coase Theorem, as a tool for determining  the most efficient allocation of rights and duties, and the ideas of John Rawls for deriving a fair social contract.  The authors then combine aspects of these two hypothetical consensus models into a unified theory of justice that considers the question of what agreements parties would enter into if they could bargain costlessly  ex ante without knowledge of which side of the bargain or situation they would ultimately obtain.

	",43.0,"Alice is seven months pregnant, and the pregnancy threatens her life. She has a constitutional right to save her life by hiring a doctor to abort the viable fetus.    
A person breaks into Katherine's home and seems about to try to kill her (or perhaps seriously injure, rape, or kidnap her). Katherine may protect her life by killing the attacker, even if the attacker isn't morally culpable, for instance if he is insane, and even though recognizing this right may let some people use false claims of self-defense to get away with killing the innocent.    
Ellen is terminally ill. Under Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. Eschenbach, decided in 2006 by the D.C. Circuit, Ellen has a constitutional right to try to save her life by hiring a doctor to administer some kinds of experimental drugs, even though federal law generally bars the use of such drugs.    
Olivia is dying of kidney failure. A kidney transplant would likely save her life, just as an abortion would save Alice's, lethal self-defense may save Katherine's, and an experimental treatment may save Ellen's. But the federal ban on payment for organs sharply limits the availability of kidneys, so Olivia will likely die if she must wait for a donated kidney (just as Alice, Ellen, and Katherine would be in jeopardy if abortions, experimental treatments, and weapons could only be provided for free).    
My claim is that all four cases involve the exercise of a person's presumptive right to self-defense - lethal self-defense in Katherine's case, and what I call medical self-defense in the others.    
This is a constitutional right: Roe and Casey secure not just a pre-viability right to abortion as reproductive choice, but also a separate post-viability right to abortion as medical self-defense when pregnancy threatens a woman's life. And given that Alice has such a right to defend herself by getting an abortion, Ellen and Olivia should have the same right to defend themselves through other medical procedures. It can't be that a woman has a constitutional right to protect her life using medical procedures, but only when doing so kills a viable fetus.    
And the right is also supported by the long-recognized right to lethal self-defense: the right to protect your life against attack even if it means killing the attacker. The right has constitutional foundations, in substantive due process, state constitutional rights to defend life and to bear arms, and maybe the Second Amendment. But even if it's treated as just a common-law and statutory right, our accepting it should lead us to accept a similar common-law or statutory right to defend one's life against medical threats as well as against human or animal threats.    
The right of medical self-defense thus offers an extra foundation for the Abigail Alliance holding that there is a constitutional right to use experimental therapies to protect one's life. And it makes the organ sales ban presumptively improper and unconstitutional when the organs are needed to protect people's lives; some concerns about organ markets may justify regulations of such markets, but not prohibition.

	",55.0,"This article explains the continuing problems with protecting human health under the current Federal Clean Air Act's Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) program. In particular, the article focuses on the difficulties in protecting the public from residual health risks, when maximum technological controls have been put into place on all sources. The article then examines the causes of this problem, concluding that they can be traced to problems in the statutory implementation and enforcement regime concerning residual health risks. This problem is not unique to health protection with air toxics and is consistent with general theories of implementation of public health protection statutes.

	",21.0,"The existing literature on international macroeconomic policy coordination makes the unrealistic assumption that policy-makers all know the true model, from which it follows in general that the Nash bargaining solution is superior to the Nash non-cooperative solution. But everything changes once we recognize that policy-makers' models differ from each other and therefore from the ""true"" model. It is still true that the two countries will in general be able to agree on a cooperative policy package that each believes will improve the objective function relative to the Nash non-cooperative solution. However, the bargaining solution is as likely to move the target variables in the wrong direction as in the right direction, in the light of a third true model. This paper illustrates these theoretical points with monetary and fiscal multipliers taken from simulations of eight leading international econometric models. (It is a sequel to NBER Working Paper 1925, which considered coordination between the domestic monetary and fiscal authorities.) Here we first consider coordination between U.S. and non-U.S. central banks. We find that out of 512 possible combinations of models that could represent U.S. beliefs, non-U.S. beliefs and the true model, coordination improves U.S. welfare in only 289 cases, reducing it in 206, and improves the welfare of other OECD countries in only 297 cases, reducing it in 198. Then we consider coordination with both monetary and fiscal policy. We find that out of 512 combinations, coordination improves U.S. welfare in 183 cases, reducing it in 228, and improves the welfare of other OECD countries in 283 cases, reducing it in 219. A final section of the paper considers possible extensions of the framework, dealing with uncertainty.

	",,"This Article contends that the legal rules regulating the search warrant process must be revised in light of the demands of digital evidence collection. Existing rules are premised on the one-step process of traditional searches and seizures: the police obtain a warrant to enter the place to be searched and retrieve the property named in the warrant. Computer technologies tend to bifurcate the process into two steps: the police first execute a physical search to seize computer hardware, and then later execute a second electronic search to obtain the data from the seized computer storage device. The failure of law to account for the two-stage process of computer searches and seizures has caused a great deal of doctrinal confusion, and makes it difficult (if not impossible) for the law to regulate the warrant process effectively. The Article concludes by offering a series of proposed amendments to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to update the warrant process for the era of digital evidence.

Evidence from a new laboratory study of Chilean high school students shows that small-stakes risk aversion and short-run discounting are less common among those with higher standardized test scores, although anomalies persist even among the highest-scoring individuals. The relationship with test scores does not appear to result from differences in parental education or wealth. A laboratory experiment shows that reducing cognitive resources using a cognitive load manipulation tends to exacerbate small-stakes risk aversion, with similar but statistically weaker effects on short-run impatience. Explicit reasoning about choice seems to reduce the prevalence of these anomalies, especially among the less skilled. Survey evidence suggests that the role of cognitive ability may extend to adult behaviors that are related to small-stakes risk preference and short-run time preference.

The advantages of the new test are confirmed by Monte Carlo experiments and in an empirical exercise, where we compare a large number of regression-based forecasts of annual US inflation to a simple random walk forecast.

	",12.0,"The catastrophic terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 caused unprecedented insured losses. While the insurance industry covered these losses, it also took swift steps to limit its exposure to such risks in the future. In response to ensuing market dislocations, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) was passed in 2002. The law temporarily requires primary insurers to offer terrorism coverage and creates a federal ""backstop"" to limit losses on such coverage. In anticipation of the program's scheduled expiration, and to inform debate on its possible extension, this article analyzes market developments in the wake of 9/11 and the passage of TRIA. We find that to date, TRIA has facilitated private sector participation in the market for terrorism insurance by lending structure to an otherwise ill-defined risk. While alternative terrorism risk bearing mechanisms are evolving, none appear ready to replace federal involvement presently. We conclude that a continuation of TRIA for a period of time would enhance U.S. economic performance in the near term. Failing to extend TRIA in the near term would result in decreased economic performance absent another major terrorist attack and greater instability, job loss, and bankruptcy in the event of another attack.

	",,"The contribution of this thesis is to present a framework to analyse firms controlled by more than one board. The literature survey of Chapter 2 revealed that there is little recognition of this phenomenon and no accepted way to investigate firms governed by multiple control centres described as a ""compound board"". The framework is developed in Chapter 3. The historical emergence of compound boards is outlined in Chapter 4 with examples of their architecture described in Chapters 5 and 6. Chapter 7 shows how the framework provides insights not available from other theories of the firm and how selfyes governance can be furthered by utilising contrary human attributes of competition/co-operation, trust/suspicion and self-interest/altruism.    
The framework is described as transaction byte analysis (TBA) as it is based on the limited and inconsistent ability of humans to transact units of information described as ""bytes"". TBA identifies cybernetic principles and strategies that can mitigate human limitations in processing bytes.  These provide organisational design criteria for firms to obtain operating advantages. As information is a common element in varies theories of the firm, TBA relates and subsumes them while allowing any type of organisation to be analysed.    
Propositions are presented in Chapter 7 for illustrating how TBA provides insights into explaining: (i) why non-trivial employee owned industrial firms have more than one board; (ii) why self-regulation and self-governance of non-trivial firms cannot be assured without a compound board; (iii) how compound boards can simplify the role, knowledge, duties and liabilities of directors; (iv) the competitive advantages of appropriate compound boards in relation to unitary control systems; (v) how to compare and evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of firms with different ownership and control structures; (vi) how to compare the relative efficacy of hierarchical and non-hierarchical firms be they in the private or public sector.

	",273.0,"In the aftermath of Governor Ryan's decision to commute the sentences of each offender on Illinois' death row, various scholars have claimed that Ryan's action was cruel, callous, a grave injustice, and, from a retributivist perspective, an unmitigated moral disaster. This Article contests that position, showing not only why a commutation of death row is permitted under principles of retributive justice, but also why it might be required. When properly understood, retributive justice, in its commitment to moral accountability and equal liberty, hinges on modesty and dignity in modes of punishment. In this vein, retributivism opposes the apparently ineluctable slide towards ever-harsher punishments in the name of justice.  While the thesis I defend is sited in the particular context of the death penalty, the implications reach more broadly; the argument offered here signals that a commitment to retributivism in no way impedes the realization of humane institutions of criminal justice and a rejection of the benighted, misbegotten, and often brutal status quo we shamefully permit to endure.

The data set employed is an annual time-series of state cross-sections for the 48 contiguous states of the U.S. from 1982 through 1988. Total and alterative alcohol involved motor vehicle fatality rates, for the general population and for 18 to 20 year olds, are used as measures of drunk driving. The results indicate that the moat effective policies are increased beer taxes and mandatory administrative license actions. Maintaining the beer tax at its real 1951 value would have reduced fatalities by 11.5 percent annually, on average, during the sample period. A mandatory administrative license sanction of one year would have reduced fatalities by 9 percent. The next most effective policies are a 21 year old legal drinking age, preliminary breath test and dram shop laws and relatively large mandatory fines. These policies each reduce total fatalities by about 5 to 6 percent. No plea bargaining provisions and mandatory license sanctions upon conviction are also found to have some deterrent effect. Other drunk driving laws tested include mandatory jail sentences and community service options, illegal per se laws, and open container laws. None of these were found to have a deterrent effect on drunk driving.

	",95.0,"Major conceptual contributions of a number of Nobel-laureates in putting forth a framework linking the citizenry's right to know and access to information with development, have already had a major influence in various fields. However, implementation of transparency-related reforms on the ground remains checkered around the globe. Further, in contrast with other dimensions of governance - such as rule of law and regulatory burden - there is a gap between the extent of the conceptual contributions in the transparency field and the progress on its measurement and empirical analysis, which has been wanting. And there has been an absence of writings which decompose (or 'unbundle') the generic notion of transparency into specific components, so to provide tools useful for policy advise and interventions. Our paper is a contribution attempting to partly fill these empirical and policy-related gaps. We review the existing literature, present various definitions of transparency, provide an initial empirical framework towards worldwide indicators on various dimensions of transparency, suggest some initial empirical results, and address concrete policy and institutional innovations related to transparency reforms.    
We contribute to empirics by undertaking an initial construction of a transparency index for 194 countries based on over twenty 20 independent sources. An Unobserved Component Model (UCM) was used to generate the country ratings and the margins of error. The indices comprise an aggregate transparency index with two sub-components: economic/institutional transparency, and political transparency. The results emphasize variance. First, the preliminary evidence based on these initial indicators suggests enormous variation across countries in the extent of transparency. Exemplary transparency is not the exclusive domain of a particular region, and there are transparency-related challenges in countries in each region and income categories. Further, there is significant within-country variation, with large differences in performance between economic/institutional and political dimensions of transparency. Mindful of the challenges in inferring causality, we also find that transparency is associated with better socio-economic and human development indicators, as well as with higher competitiveness and lower corruption. We suggest that much progress can be attained without requiring inordinate amount of resources, since transparency reforms can be substantial net 'savers' of public resources, and often can serve as a more efficient and less financially costly substitute to creating additional regulations and/or regulatory or governance bodies. We emphasize that different types of transparency reforms are warranted for different stages of political-economic development, and that much more prominence ought to be given to transparency reforms as a core component of second-generation institutional reforms. We provide a number of concrete examples of specific transparency-related reforms within a strategic framework, as well as a brief country illustration - the case of Chile.

Program participation lowers growth rates for as long as countries remain under a program.

In particular, dynamic models that utilize forward-looking variables and address various types of bank risk individually are promising lines of inquiry.

	",8.0,"There are two approaches to employer bullying in the Canadian common law of employment.  One approach treats it as a breach of an implied term of the employment contract requiring fair dealing (repudiation by breach of contract, or RBB).  The other treats it as a repudiation of contract without any breach (repudiation without breach, or RWB), because bullying makes the employment relationship intolerable.  This paper compares these two approaches and contrast them with the British model, which treats employer bullying as a breach of an contractual implied term requiring the preservation of mutual trust and confidence.  The author argues that the RWB approach provides a narrower scope of protection for employees than the RBB approach and discounts the possibility that separate damages should be available for breach of an implied term requiring fair dealing.  The author considers the complicating factor of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Wallace.  That case requires all damages resulting from employer bullying in the manner of dismissal to be treated as an extension to the reasonable notice required for termination of contract.  This means that employer bullying in the performance of the contract can be treated as a distinct breach of the implied duty on Canadian employers to treat employees with decency, civility, respect, and dignity.  The author proposes a test for distinguishing bullying conduct that is in the performance of the contract and conduct that is in the manner of dismissal.

Our results are consistent with Soviet draw-collusion and inconsistent with Soviet competition.

	",6.0,"Professionalism is a concept widely articulated within the legal community, yet a clear and uniform definition remains elusive. Legal commentators from the academy, the judiciary, and the practicing bar continuously attempt to define professionalism with negligible resolution. It is a term that is often used, perhaps overused in conversation, and at times underutilized in legal practice, thereby transforming itself from an ideal into a cliche over time.    
As a result, professionalism holds various meanings and the contextual nature of professionalism requires a definitional reshaping as circumstances and players change. In an effort to examine the concept of professionalism from various perspectives, this article explores the meaning of professionalism from our own perspectives, as well as those of students, clients, adversaries, and judges.     
The purposes of this Article are threefold: (1) to emphasize the dynamic and adaptable nature of professionalism, especially in the context of litigation; (2) to explore the various points of view of professionalism, with a focus upon clinical law practice; and (3) to suggest that we, as clinical law professors, utilize these observations of adapting professionalism in our teaching. Additionally, this Article explores how, as clinical law professors, we may use the various perspectives of professionalism as lessons and learning tools for our law students.     
This Article is divided into six parts. Part I examines the role and perspective of the clinical law professor in teaching and defining professionalism in context. Part II identifies the perspectives of law students who are learning about professionalism. Part III documents many of our clients' perspectives and how we can teach law students professional behavior through representation of clients. Parts IV and V address the unique perspectives of the bar and bench and how we should teach law students to recognize and respond to opponents' and judges' concepts of professional behavior. Part VI summarizes our thesis - that professionalism should be taught explicitly in the clinical setting from a variety of contexts.

	",51.0,"In a series of hearings in 1997 and 1998, Congress heard allegations that the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"" or ""Service"") was abusing taxpayers during the process of collecting taxes.  The resulting distrust of the tax bureaucracy led Congress to create a special adversary proceeding providing for judicial review of IRS collection decisions.  The proceeding is beguilingly titled ""Collection Due Process"" (and commonly referred to as ""CDP"").  My study of CDP's structure, operation, and of 976 court decisions issued through the end of 2006 demonstrates that it has not fulfilled its promise.  It is instead an outstanding regulatory failure.  Of the over 15 million collection decisions made since 2000, courts have reviewed at most 3,000 and have reversed only 16.  That is a reversal rate of about one in a million.  Adversary process is not an effective regulatory mechanism to check government abuses in the modern administrative state.    	       This article pursues two goals.  First, it documents and explains CDP's failure to provide a meaningful external check on tax collection abuses.  In fact, CDP most likely hurts those who most need its promised protection from arbitrary agency action:  the working poor who risk seeing their Earned Income Tax Credit subsidies snatched away by the over-reaching tax collector.  Second, the article links CDP's failure to larger questions of the proper role for adversary process in the administrative state.  Some commentators contend there can be no proper ""rule of law"" without adversarial process.   This study of CDP proves the opposite claim:  adversarial process, used in the wrong place and the wrong time, becomes a rule of deception rather than a rule of law. CDP is a failure on many levels, but an instructive one for it tells much about the problem of using adversarial process in the administrative state.  	       This article proceeds in four parts.  Because Administrative Law is breathtakingly parochial, the reader needs to understand the particular context of this regulatory program in order to understand the larger point it illustrates.  Thus, Part I gives the conceptual overview of tax administration necessary to understand both the evaluation and critique of CDP.  Part II then explains the origins and operations of CDP.  Part III applies the theory of tax administration developed in Part I to larger administrative law concepts to show how CDP fails to serve its promised purpose, and how it actually harms both taxpayers and the cause of good tax administration.  Part IV sketches out some ideas about how tax collection might be structured along the lines of what I term ""inquisitorial due process.""

	",27.0,"Using an asset-based model of default, I derive rating characteristics if ratings are meant to look 'through the cycle' as opposed to being based on the borrowers' current condition. The through-the-cycle method, which is employed by most rating agencies, requires a separation of permanent and cyclical components of default risk. In a time series setting, this can be done through the Kalman filter. The analysis shows that many empirical irregularities of agency ratings could be the consequence of such a rating method. The stability of through-the-cycle ratings is higher than that of their current-condition counterparts, and their correlation with actual default probabilities is relatively low. Though not predictable in the usual sense, rating changes exhibit several properties which call for a reconsideration of the existing evidence.

	",14.0,"The mutual fund is a superb concept, a vehicle for investors to pool their savings in a diversified portfolio and thus acquire experienced management, as well as economies of scale in fees and expenses.  Mutual funds offer, too, remarkable flexibility, the ability to withdraw at will even modest sums, at the underlying asset value.  Being a favored child of the law, investors receive detailed disclosures, a safe harbor from double taxation, and SEC oversight.  Markets fluctuate, but a mutual fund's diversity and presumably skilled management allow the investor to take a longer view, freeing him from the concern that Stock A or B will report lower earnings next week.  Clearly, those thrifty Scots had a brilliant idea, and equity mutual funds alone now have $4 trillion in assets, up from a mere $250 billion as recently as 1990.      
What follows is a speech I gave in December 2005 before the NY Society of Security Analysts.  It was billed as a celebration of Graham-and-Dodd style value investing, and indeed the invitation had been a consequence of an article I wrote earlier that year, in which I explored a dramatically successful group of patient investors (""Searching for Rational Investors in a Perfect Storm"").  I used the occasion to take a broader look at mutual funds, and in particular to study large cap growth funds, which it developed play the performance game, turning over their portfolios at stunning rates with disheartening results for investors, though not for the managers.  An update of my earlier study provided a useful benchmark.

	",30.0,"Laws requiring minors to seek parental consent or to notify a parent prior to obtaining an abortion raise the cost of risky sex for teenagers. Assuming choices to engage in risky sex are made rationally, parental involvement laws should lead to less risky sex among teens, either because of a reduction of sexual activity altogether or because teens will be more fastidious in the use of birth control ex ante. Using gonorrhea rates among older women to control for unobserved heterogeneity across states, our results indicate that the enactment of parental involvement laws significantly reduces risky sexual activity among teenage girls. We estimate reductions in gonorrhea rates of 20 percent for Hispanics and 12 percent for whites. While we find a relatively small reduction in rates for black girls, it is not statistically significant. We speculate that the racial heterogeneity has to do with differences in family structure across races.

	",42.0,"The potential displacement of domestic law by international law has become a major topic of debate among both scholars and jurists. But the growing literature on the subject has largely ignored the fact that most international law is generated by undemocratic political processes. In this Article, we seek to fill this void by systematically analyzing the impact of the democracy deficit of international law on the desirability of allowing international legal rules to supplant American domestic law.    
International law that has not been ratified by domestic political processes - what we refer to as raw international law - has a particularly severe democracy deficit because it is not subject to any kind of electoral accountability. In addition, international lawmaking processes are generally less transparent to the public than domestic ones, further undermining democratic control of its content. We contend that the democracy deficit of raw international law is a strong consideration weighing against allowing it to displace American domestic law.    
The Article addresses multiple factors that contribute to the democracy deficit. We consider the role of unrepresentative publicists and international jurists in shaping international law. We also look at the materials from which they infer international law rules and find that they are influenced by nondemocratic and even totalitarian nations. Even the periodic acceptance of these norms by democratic nations is often little more than cheap talk. We offer social science data that suggests citizens are less familiar with the international than the domestic lawmaking process, thus reducing the transparency and democratic accountability of the former. Finally, we show that domestic application of raw international law has the potential to diminish the exit rights of citizens, thereby preventing them from voting with their feet and further undermining popular control over public policy.    
We then review in detail the different doctrines by which raw international law may be used in domestic jurisprudence. We argue that in each case the low quality of the processes that generate international law militate against its displacing or supplementing law made through our domestic processes.    
Not only is international law likely to be worse than United States law for Americans because of its democracy deficit, but foreigners too may be better off if the US refuses to incorporate raw international law into its domestic legal system. This possibility has also been largely ignored by the previous literature. Because of its structural position in the international system, the United States is likely to generate public goods, including good legal norms, for the rest of the world. We, of course, do not believe that United States laws that affect foreigners are likely to be perfect, but only that they are likely to be better on average than raw international law. We thus show that strict dualism - the proposition that international law should not penetrate the domestic legal regime without express domestic authorization - is a peculiarly suitable constitutional structure for the United States, precisely because it is a democratic superpower with global reach.

	",,"This article examines ordinances created during the 1990s to restrict the rapidly growing Korean immigration in several New Jersey towns.  It examines three sets of zoning laws which, although phrased in neutral language, were in fact enforced to disadvantage only the Korean newcomers:    
- Restrictions on 24-hour operations: these targeted Korean restaurants and karaoke clubs, whose hours accommodated immigrants working in service jobs.  Backers of this ordinance discussed their fear of Korean immigrants being out and about at night.  One town's ordinance specifically exempted the only 24-hour diner not owned by a Korean immigrant.    
- Restrictions on church expansions: these targeted Korean Presbyterian churches, which were increasing their social services to the immigrant community.  Selective enforcement of zoning laws shut down day care centers and children's summer camps based at the churches.    
- Restrictions on Korean-language signs: these targeted immigrant-owned businesses.  The ordinances banned signs in shop windows written in languages other than English, but the rule was enforced only against signs in Korean.     
Employing a law and literature analysis, the article examines the ordinances in the context of other ""immigration reform"" and ""official-English"" statutes then under debate across the nation.  It critiques the New Jersey ordinances as unconstitutional and details the community violence that resulted from their passage.  The article concludes by presenting alternative policy choices which, if implemented, would combat cultural fears about colonialism and achieve legislators' stated purpose to peacefully integrate immigrant populations into the larger community.

	",81.0,"The European framework for creditor protection has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years. While the ECJ's Centros case and its progeny have given EU businesses free choice with respect to the state of incorporation, and hence to the substantive corporate law regime, the European Insolvency Regulation has introduced uniform conflict of laws rules for insolvencies. However, this regime has opened up some forum shopping opportunities for corporate debtors. Both regulatory competition in corporate law and forum shopping in bankruptcy law have been discussed in the US for years, while they are relatively new territory in the EU. This article attempts to pull together the two emerging discussions and analyzes possible consequences for the relationship between shareholders, managers and creditors in European corporations. We argue that, in the absence of evidence of either a race to the top or the bottom, we cannot rule out adverse consequences of either regulatory competition in corporate law or forum shopping in bankruptcy. However, the discussion so far has largely considered only the consequences of the first type of regulatory arbitrage while neglecting the second. Hence, the issue of the ""insolvencification"" of corporate law rules has been brought up in order to enable national policymakers to impose their respective ideas about creditor protection on firms. We suggest that such attempts may be futile. First, relabeling is possible only to a rather limited degree, and second, while restricting the scope for corporate law arbitrage, it increases the incentives for forum shopping in bankruptcy. Ultimately, it may even backfire, leading to a higher degree of bankruptcy forum shopping to avoid the very rules that have been insolvencified.

It is built around a set of facts concerning the variability of unemployment and vacancies in the aggregate and, at the establishment level, the distribution of net employment growth and the comovement of hours and employment growth. A search model with frictions in hiring and firing is used as a framework to understand these observations. Notable features of this search model include non-convex costs of posting vacancies, establishment level profitability shocks and a contracting framework that determines the response of hours and wages to shocks. The search friction creates an endogenous, cyclical adjustment cost. We specify and estimate the parameters of the search model using simulated method of moments to match establishment-level and aggregate observations. The estimated search model is able to capture both the aggregate and establishment-level facts.

	",6.0,"Since the Supreme Court decided Kelo v. City of New London in June 2005, some 35 states have enacted eminent domain reforms laws. In his recent Northwestern University Law Review Colloquy article, which I have been asked to comment on, Professor David Dana argues that most post-Kelo reform efforts are seriously flawed because they tend to forbid the condemnation of the property of the wealthy and the middle class for economic development, but allow the condemnation of land on which poor people live under the guise of alleviating blight. This, he claims, ensures that the reforms enacted in numerous states ""privilege . . . the stability of middle-class households relative to the stability of poor households"" and ""express . . . the view that the interests and needs of poor households are relatively unimportant."" I agree with Professor Dana that the problem of blight condemnations and its impact on the poor deserve greater attention, but take issue with his argument that post-Kelo reform efforts have systematically treated the poor worse than middle and upper class homeowners.  
Most of the states that have enacted post-Kelo reform laws have either banned both blight and economic development takings or defined blight so broadly that virtually any property can be declared blighted and taken. Several others have enacted reforms that provide no real protection to any property owners because of other types of shortcomings. Only nine states are actually guilty of allowing only the condemnation of blighted areas, narrowly defined. Even these nine flawed reforms are probably better for the poor than no reform at all. Such a law might benefit many poor people who live in non-blighted areas and are potentially vulnerable to economic development takings. Survey data suggests that the poor themselves overwhelmingly oppose economic development condemnations, suggesting that they are not much concerned about the expressive harms that worry Professor Dana. Finally, the exclusion of blighted property from the ban on economic development condemnations in some states is not necessarily explained by indifference to or contempt for the interests of the poor. It could also be the result of other factors, such as voter ignorance about the actual effects of blight condemnations.

	",,"In his forthcoming article, Original Meaning and Abortion, Jack Balkin makes the startling disclosure that he is now an originalist.  ""[C]onstitutional interpretation,"" he writes, ""requires fidelity to the original meaning of the Constitution and to the principles that underlie the text.  The task of interpretation is to look to original meaning and underlying principle and decide how best to apply them in current circumstances.  I call this the method of text and principle.""      
In this brief reply, I caution that, to remain faithful to the Constitution when referring to underlying principles, we must never forget it is a text we are expounding.  And it is the text, properly interpreted and specified in light of its underlying principles, not the underlying principles themselves, that is to be applied to changing facts and circumstances by means of constitutional doctrines.  There is another highly familiar and very nonoriginalist way to see the relationship between ""text and principle"": One could discern the principles underlying the text, and then apply these principles directly to new circumstances.  By so doing, one can end up potentially expanding the reach of, and even contravening, the text itself.  Because Balkin sometimes appears to be endorsing the second of these two approaches to text and principle in this paper, he may give some readers the mistaken impression that he is still employing a living constitution approach under the guise of original meaning originalism.

	",25.0,"This article examines the stickiness of default rules and boilerplate terms in contract law. It argues that parties who choose to deviate from well entrenched defaults may face hurdles beyond the direct transaction costs of drafting. The mere deviation from standard terms by a proposing party may in and of itself raise suspicions for counterparties. It may conjure concerns over hidden aspects of the deal and tricky motivations - a fear of the unknown. Thus, regardless of the direct value of a non-standard, tailored term, a deviance cost associated with its proposal may offset or even cancel its benefit. Under this account, default rules are stickier, and boilerplate terms less prone to innovation, than currently perceived. The article demonstrates the existence of such stickiness by identifying default rules that vary across jurisdictions. In the absence of high transaction costs (or significant network/learning effects), one would expect robust opt-out from an undesirable default in at least some jurisdictions; unimpeded parties should gravitate toward the efficient rule. The absence of such opt-out, in any jurisdiction, is consistent with this account of stickiness.

	",46.0,"Cyberspace is being propertized at a dizzying pace.  Boundaries are being drawn, electronic fences are going up and territory is being staked out all over the Internet.  What was once - or is at least idealized as - an electronic commons, now more closely resembles a series of gated communities than an open range.  This closing of the commons raises, in turn, serious concerns of access, since it makes it evermore possible for those with resources to erect fences and keep out unwanted visitors.  Assuring equal access to cyber-resources is nonetheless an essential civil rights issue; access reinforces democratic ideals, helps guarantee equal opportunity to cyber-resources, and combats status discrimination.  This article therefore argues that it is appropriate to turn to the property law principle of public accommodation.  Recent scholarship documents the post-Civil War narrowing of the antebellum common law right of access from a regime permitting almost complete access to the post-Civil War principle of public accommodation, which, paradoxically, restricted access to large segments of the public.  In light of this scholarship, the article suggests that treating the various layers of the Internet - its physical architecture and cables, its code and its content - as places of public accommodation is consistent with the earlier, more egalitarian common law tradition and the underlying goals of public accommodation law today.  Given the reach, influence and potential of the Internet, this more expansive approach should, the article explains, be applied to regulation of today's cyberplaces.  While conceding that conceptual problems exist in order to conceive of Internet space as equivalent to real space, the article nonetheless contends that a focus on the right of access and a corresponding duty to serve can resolve any hesitation in approaching regulation of the Internet as a place of public accommodation.  It therefore outlines various approaches to the regulation of the Internet's parts as places of public accommodation, both in light of decided case law (mostly in the disabilities rights context, the most active area of public accommodation jurisprudence today) and contemporary property theory that insists upon a multi-faceted, entitlement-based approach to ownership.

	",28.0,"It has now been ten years since the idea of global online communication first entered the popular consciousness.  And while the internet has undoubtedly opened up new worlds of interaction and cooperation across borders, this increased transnational activity has also at times inspired parochialism, at least among the legislatures and courts of nation-states around the globe.  Such assertions of national authority have helped to reawaken scholarly interest in the classic triumvirate of topics historically grouped together under the rubric of conflicts of laws: jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of judgments.    
In a previous article, I argued that territorially-based conceptions of legal jurisdiction may no longer be adequate in an era when ideas of bounded nation-state communities operating within fixed territorial borders are under challenge.  I offered instead what I called a cosmopolitan pluralist conception of jurisdiction: cosmopolitan because it recognized the possibility that people can hold multiple, sometimes non-territorial, community affiliations; and pluralist because it acknowledged that forms of legal (or quasi-legal) jurisdiction can be asserted by communities that are not official state-sanctioned courts.  This essay turns the focus to choice of law and recognition of judgments.  Analyzing three recent U.S. cases (two involving choice of law and one addressing recognition of judgments), I seek to apply some of the principles of cosmopolitanism to consider how courts should understand their institutional role in cases raising multinational concerns.    
Taking seriously the observation that in conflicts scholarship there is nothing truly new under the sun, the cosmopolitan perspective I offer here does not purport to create a new theory of choice of law.  Instead, it combines aspects of each of the three major choice-of-law regimes of the twentieth century-vested rights, governmental interests, and the substantive law method - to shape an overall attitude with which judges can approach cases involving conflicting transnational legal norms.  This attitude starts from the idea that governments have an interest not only in helping in-state litigants win the particular litigation at issue, but a more important longer-term interest in being cooperative members of an international system and sharing in its reciprocal benefits and burdens.  Similarly, with regard to judgment recognition, the cosmopolitan perspective asks judges to consider the independent value of enforcing a foreign judgment, even when that judgment is contrary to local policy choices.  Moreover, the cosmopolitan approach focuses less on literal contacts with a territorially-based sovereign entity and more on the extent to which the various parties might be deemed to have affiliations with the possible communities seeking to impose their norms.  Thus, while derived from various extant conflicts theories, the cosmopolitan perspective yields a distinctive approach, and one that I believe is better suited to a world of interconnection, interrelationship, and multiple community affiliations.

	",,"The U.S. promotes and produces innovation through a wide range of interdependent institutions, ranging from the grant of an intellectual property right to the direct funding of research.  The justification for using multiple instruments is intuitively rather simple:  no single institution would efficiently supply all classes of innovations.  Why this intuitively simple explanation holds true in theory and practice is a much more difficult question.  The answer depends in part on what type of ""good"" innovation is and in part on how amenable certain types of innovation are to certain forms of institutional provision.  To put it more concretely, (1) innovation is a public good that acts as an input for producing a wide range of dependent goods, private to public, including more innovation; (2) various forms of innovation market failure arise, often depending on the type of dependent good that the innovation is expected to produce; and (3) certain institutions are better suited for correcting certain forms of innovation market failure.  A comprehensive understanding of each of these aspects of innovation allows one to address the theoretical yet practical policy questions of what the appropriate ""mix"" of institutions is (or might look like) and whether the current system is doing well at providing the efficient amount of innovation.    
This paper integrates the dynamic nature of the innovative process with classic economic theory of public goods and investment decision making.  The focus is generally on the ex ante considerations that precede public or private investment in research.  Innovations are classified in terms of their expected uses.  The underlying purpose of this paper is to formulate a framework for evaluating science and technology policy and for determining what form of government institution is best targeted for particular classes of innovation.    
Parts I (A Model of Innovation), II (The Market for Innovation), and III (Institutional Innovation) develop an analytical framework for innovation policy.  There are three foundational themes explored:  (1) the nature of innovation itself, (2) the innovation market, and (3) institutions.  Innovation and the innovation market must be clearly understood for an assessment of institutions to proceed, and the institutions themselves must be well understood for any comparison to be meaningful.  To ground the theoretical analysis in an existing legal regime, Part IV analyzes the Mixed Incentive System for Publicly Funded Researchers created by the Bayh-Dole Act, in which intellectual property rights and government support are jointly used to promote, produce, and commercialize federally funded research results.

	",13.0,"In this article, we attempt to answer some fundamental questions regarding the role played by the courts in the patent system by examining a set of patent cases in great detail.  To this end, we have constructed a new database based on court docket reports for all patent cases filed in 1995 and 1997 and tracked the evolution of these cases (about 3700 cases) through to settlement or adjudication on the merits.  The focus of this effort is on keeping track of a number of variables to understand the precise disposition of each case.    
We have also tracked different characteristics in order to estimate patent litigation costs in each case.  For instance, we note the amount of time taken by each case through to final disposition.  In addition, we have devised a new proxy for measuring costs - the number of documents filed by all the parties in each case - which we believe is more closely correlated with actual litigation costs than the traditional measures of time expended and the stage of termination in each case.     
Our results show that many more patent cases are adjudicated on the merits (either at the pre-trial stage through a grant of summary judgment or at trial) than is commonly thought.  This work is one of the few scholarly efforts in empirical litigation scholarship that can actually estimate this amount because most other papers rely exclusively on the imprecise categorization of the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts to determine case outcomes.  Our results demonstrate that in addition to the small number of patent cases going to trial (about 5%), another significant percentage of cases (about 8-9%) are resolved on the merits through summary judgment.  Consequently, summary judgments are important in patent cases for determining patent validity and infringement, and the summary judgments related to patent validity occur earlier in the litigation compared to summary judgments related to patent infringement.  This result is somewhat encouraging given the important role played by the courts in revoking patent rights improvidently granted at the outset by the PTO.  Nevertheless, despite the fact that such rulings occur early in the proceedings compared to patent trials, we should still be concerned about the huge transaction costs associated with patent litigation because summary judgments in general, and summary judgment based on invalidity in particular, are expensive compared to summary judgments granted on other grounds.     
In addition, there is a significant difference in duration and number of documents filed in cases resolved through summary judgment for the 1997 filed cases compared to the 1995 filed cases.  This is consistent with the changes brought about by the Markman decision that invigorated claim construction as a threshold legal issue in patent litigation.  The increased importance placed on first construing the claims before addressing infringement or invalidity after Markman necessitates that significant resources be allotted to the step of claim construction before (or concurrent with) filing motions for summary judgment.    
Overall, our results show that transaction costs associated with patent litigation loom large, and rulings on the merits by the courts concerning patent validity, patent infringement, and remedies for infringement (i.e., injunctive relief or damages) are rare, expensive, and not pursued to completion by most litigants. Instead, most patent cases settle fairly quickly (about 12-15 months) after the filing of the complaint, thereby reducing the actual cost of patent litigation considerably.     
This work has significant implications for all civil litigation in general, and for recent efforts to reform the patent system by either improving patent quality through new administrative procedures at the PTO or for substantive patent law reform.  Our results strongly suggest that patent litigation is largely a settlement mechanism, and hence, any proposed change in the patent laws should be analyzed in terms of the incentives generated for prompt settlement of patent disputes.  In addition, entities and interest groups seeking cheaper and/or a greater number of patent rulings concerning validity and infringement will be wise to look elsewhere, perhaps at other patent institutions such as the PTO or at other alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms that complement the courts.

	",32.0,"There is a peculiar point of agreement between prominent defenders of originalist and dynamic interpretive methods, that their preferred interpretive approach applies not just to statutes or to the Constitution, but to both. In this Article, I challenge this shared position - as represented by Justice Antonin Scalia's originalist textualism and Professor William Eskridge's dynamic interpretive theory. I argue that the democratic and rule-of-law values that these theories invoke in fact suggest that different interpretive approaches govern constitutional and statutory interpretation. I contend, first, that disjunctures between the democratic justification for originalism in constitutional and statutory interpretation reveal the distinct democratic foundations of these two forms of enacted law, and provide reasons for interpreting them differently. I next argue that the rule-of-law virtue of stability developed in Professor Eskridge's theory pushes constitutional and statutory interpretation apart because, on Professor Eskridge's view, predictive judgments about how other institutions will respond to a decision are central to the Court's interpretive exercise, and those predictive judgments will differ depending on the interpretive domain at issue.  Finally, I defend this interpretive particularism by suggesting reasons why interpretive approaches should vary depending on the theory of legal authority applicable to the type or class of law in question.

	",30.0,"The Rule of Law faces critical challenges both at home and abroad.  At home, legal indeterminacy and the ontological gap between legal theory and practice defy resolution by contemporary normative theories of law.  Legal indeterminacy raises the specter that judicial decisions in hard cases are illegitimate (political not legal) because judges must rely on personal political, moral, or religious beliefs.  The ""ontological gap"" between the practice of law, which presupposes a classical or religious ontology, and legal theory, which presupposes a scientific ontology (i.e., scientific materialism), further reveals the irrelevance of legal theory (including conceptions of the rule of law) to the practice of law.  Abroad, the rule of law is debunked as a Western construct that aims to advance U.S. imperialistic ambitions.  Without a sufficient normative theory, the rule of law or ""the soul of the modern state"" is in serious peril in the U.S. and even more questionable as an export abroad.    
To address this predicament, this article analyzes China's efforts to implement the rule of law and proposes a constructive, post-modern normative theory of law based on the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead and the radical empiricism of William James.  This ""process theory of natural law"" provides a novel theory of natural law that eliminates the perceived illegitimacy arising from legal indeterminacy and closes the ontological gap.  Process natural law also mediates many of the cultural differences between the East and the West through the telos of beauty (unity-in-diversity), which entails maximizing both an Eastern aesthetic sense of order (emergent harmony or spontaneous order) and a Western rational sense of order (complexity arising from diverse individual orderings).  This conception of the rule of law further allows for important cultural differences to be reflected in the interpretation of democracy and formal legality and in the instantiation of individual rights in the law.  Thus, the ideal rule of law may look quite different in the U.S. and China and may continue to evolve in our constantly changing, pluralistic, and multicultural world.

	",20.0,"In its recent Trinko decision, the Supreme Court opined that Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Co., 472 U.S. 585 (1985), established the ""outer boundaries"" of antitrust liability for refusals to deal.  Aspen, it is said, involved particularized facts suggesting that the refusal to deal was more likely anticompetitive than most other such refusals.  In so doing, the Court echoed the view of many scholars and lower courts that facts such as those present in Aspen properly give rise to a prima facie violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.    
This essay offers a property-based critique of Aspen.  Aspen, it is shown, failed to notice that the defendant's so-called refusal to deal with a joint venture partner was likely part of an effort to negotiate a contractual property right that would have encouraged promotional expenditures and thus furthered interbrand competition between different skiing destinations.  Thus, Aspen went too far in regulating refusals to deal, and courts should no longer treat the decision as a useful point of reference when examining refusal to deal claims.    
Property's right to exclude implies the ability to refuse to deal with one's rivals.  Indeed, ""competition on the merits,"" the summum bonum of antitrust law, depends upon the right of an efficient monopolist to decline to sell its output to rivals.  Without this right, firms could demand that their most efficient rival sell them its output at cost, thus eliminating incentives for all market participants unilaterally to realize technological efficiencies such as economies of scale.    
Still, protection of ""competition on the merits"" does not exhaust the beneficial functions of refusals to deal.  Such refusals may also facilitate so-called ""contractual competition,"" that is, the use of voluntary contracts to overcome or attenuate market failures.  All bargaining depends upon an implied threat not to deal with a potential partner.  The Aspen defendant's purported ""refusal to deal"" stemmed from its efforts to renegotiate the contractual formula governing the allocation of the fruits of its joint enterprise with the plaintiff.  The plaintiff refused to accept the defendant's new terms, walked away from the venture and demanded that the defendant continue to deal with it outside the context of their original venture.  Thus, the plaintiff brought about its own fate by effectively refusing to deal on the defendant's terms.    
The Aspen Court nonetheless affirmed a verdict condemning the defendant's purported refusal, without first asking whether the terms offered by the defendant were reasonable or exclusionary.  The Court also failed to notice that the defendant's new terms were apparently designed to create a contractual property right that would allow it to internalize most of the benefits of its promotional efforts aimed at luring interstate travelers to Aspen.  To be sure, the Court pointed to several facts that purportedly justified the jury's verdict.  For instance, the Court found it noteworthy that the defendant embarked on an expanded promotional campaign after the venture ceased.  The Court also thought it important that the defendant had ended an arrangement that had apparently served it well for several years.  Still, each of these facts, as well as the plaintiff's claim that the refusal prevented it from engaging in intrabrand competition, was at least equally consistent with an assertion that the defendant was simply seeking to alter the terms of dealing so as to create a wealth-enhancing contractual property right.  Thus, Aspen stands as a dubious precedent, and courts should contract the outer boundaries of antitrust liability for refusals to deal.

United States, 503 U.S. 540 (1992), a landmark case in the revitalization of the entrapment defense. In Jacobson, the Supreme Court found that the defense of entrapment was available as a matter of law, even though the defendant had been convicted by a jury of the unsavory offense of receiving child pornography. 5 to 4, the Court was persuaded that the 26-month-long sting operation, which involved numerous mailings and letters, persuaded a person who had never before purchased unlawful child pornography do do so. Accordingly, Jacobson was not criminally liable. Jacobson has had a substantial impact. The decision provided the basis for juries to acquit based on overaggressive police tactics, and for judges - including those with hard-nosed reputations like Richard Posner and Alex Kosinski - to reverse when juries convicted where the evidence showed police encouragement overcame a defendant's initial reluctance to commit an offense. In addition, some scholars have claimed that Jacobson is the first supreme court majority opinion which expressed the slightest empathy for any homosexual.

Reforming European Pension Systems Conference, September 24 & 25, 2004, Castle of Schengen, Luxembourg, Luxembourg Institute for European and International Studies (LIEIS),  Available at SSRN: 
		
	",,"On the first anniversary of the death of Nobel Laureate Professor Franco Modigliani, the Luxembourg Institute for European and International Studies (LIEIS) organised a conference on 'Reforming European Pension Systems' on 24 and 25 September 2004 in Schengen.    
Initially, the intention was to hold this conference in the presence of Professor Modigliani who had written a comprehensive paper for the LIEIS. However, due to ill health, such a meeting had to be postponed repeatedly. A third date was set two days before Professor Modigliani's death. One year on, the LIEIS convened colleagues and friends to honour his memory and life-long work and to discuss his ideas in relation to pension reforms in Europe.    
In the course of 5 sessions, approximately 30 participants from about 10 countries debated the following questions:    
(1) the open legacy of Franco Modigliani and European pension reforms    
(2) the Modigliani-Muralidhar approach to pension reform    
(3) various funding modes and issues of transition    
(4) lessons and outlook on pension reforms in Europe    
(5) alternatives for pension reform in Luxembour    
Our research paper, which will appear in abridged form in the forthcoming Conference volume, published by Rozenberg publishers, Amsterdam, compares the cross national effects of pension reform on 33 indicators of social, economic, political and ecological well-being of nations with the effects on these 33 variables by dependency, the adherence to the advice by international financial institutions, world political or world cultural identities; the aging process; feminism, militarism; the public education effort and the development level.     
Traditionally, world system approaches explain human and economic misery by the dependent insertion of the periphery and the semi-periphery into the global economy.     
It is true that the ascending countries of East Asia, whose investment is often much higher than their savings rate, are at the winning side in the global social equation. It is also true that unequal exchange (ERDI) is still an important phenomenon, significantly explaining many processes of development. However, the privatization of public education, especially at the Third level, the developmental negative consequences of female distribution coalitions as well as the imperative of pension reform have been up to now neglected in cross-national development research. Interestingly enough, economic freedom as such is also not as relevant as pension reform in explaining economic or social success in the world system. We can say that foreign savings and pension reforms are among the most highly influential positive determinants of development today, while culturalist theories and dependency theories fail to achieve the levels of significance we had originally expected when compared to the new cross-national variable pension reform. These findings have important repercussions for the European debate on pension reform and the Lisbon strategy to catch up with the US by 2010 to make Europe the most competitive region in the world economy.     
European Union membership years by themselves are lamentably enough a rather negative determinant of the processes of development due to the cumbersome mechanisms and distribution coalitions that European institutions present, and the reliance of many countries in the European Union on publicly financed systems of education also has to be reconsidered. Political feminism is another master variable of the European political discourse and it is the main loser in the 1990s and the early years of the 21st Century, indicating again that political distribution coalitions are likely to lose today and tomorrow. The results reported clearly indicate that world systems studies would be well advised to take the processes of pension reform very seriously.     
To neglect pension funds in investigations about the capitalist world economy would be misleading at any rate. Private pension funds already amount to 44% of current world GDP, with countries like the United States; Japan; United Kingdom; Netherlands; Canada; Switzerland; Australia; Sweden; Ireland; Finland; and Denmark taking the lead in fund development either via the introduction of a World Bank three pillar models or simply via a strong element of private pensions (the third pillar) besides the first, traditional PAYGO pillar (like presently in the United States of America). Slow pension fund development in most countries of the Euro-zone determines that the overall share of private pension funds from the Euro-zone is just over 2% of world GDP. If Europe wants to fulfill its Lisbon agenda of catching up with the United States, it must overhaul its pension systems and introduce some form or other of private pension funds, which are a major force in financing technological advance in the capitalist world economy today.     
Our investigations also clearly show that World Bank pension reforms are associated in a positive way with the rates of change of a country's performance to the better.

	",38.0,"The astounding success of the Harry Potter series of children's fantasy novels is an unexpected cultural phenomenon, but a welcome one for lawyers and legal academics: Harry's story is a story about law, and about a society trying to establish a rule of law. There is law in every chapter, and on almost every page, of all six books. Sometimes the legal questions hang in the background, while at other times they are the focus of the story: We see numerous trials, and the author gives us statutes, regulations, school rules, and even international agreements to consider.    
Harry's world is administered, ineptly, by the Ministry of Magic. The Ministry of Magic's muddling misrule is not quite dictatorship, but it is not fair and just, either. Under the stress of the first war against Voldemort's Death Eaters the Ministry regime, like some Muggle governments in similar circumstances, adopted an ad hoc and inconsistent approach to justice. It imprisons people, and sometimes executes them, without a trial. It keeps careful tabs on law-abiding citizens, but is unable to track down terrorists. It reaches inaccurate results in about half of its criminal trials, in large part because defendants are not represented by counsel. This article attempts to examine the problems with the wizarding word's legal system by focusing on one particular problem: the Unforgivable Curses, three spells whose use on humans is punishable by life imprisonment. The three Unforgivable Curses are the Cruciatus Curse, which causes unbearable pain; the Imperius Curse, which allows the user to control the actions of the victim; and the Killing Curse, which causes instant death.    
There are inconsistencies both in the application of the law and in the selection of certain curses as Unforgivable.

	",14.0,"In Another Place Beyond Here:  The Death Penalty Moratorium Movement in the United States, Professor Kirchmeier examines the recent decline in support for the death penalty in the United States and the resulting emergence of a movement to impose a moratorium on executions.  After discussing the history of the death penalty abolition movement in the United States, he identifies five major and seven minor events that have contributed to the growth of the Death Penalty Moratorium Movement.  Then, he compares the current Moratorium Movement to other similar reform periods:  the 1960s Death Penalty Abolitionist Movement; legislative abolition of the death penalty in several states during the mid-1800s and early 1900s; death penalty abolition in other countries; and the Anti-Lynching Movement of the early 1900s.      
Based on the history of these other movements, Professor Kirchmeier discovers various lessons for today's Moratorium Movement, including lessons about strategy and the roles of public opinion and leadership.  Finally, using these lessons from history and looking at recent events, he considers the future of the Moratorium Movement.  Professor Kirchmeier concludes that for the Movement to continue to be successful:  (1) there must be no major national distracting forces; (2) the Movement must continue to broaden its arguments and not be overly dependent upon one issue, one person, or one strategy; (3) the Movement must continue seek support from unexpected voices; and (4) the Movement must stay focused on the goals of achieving popular support and creating new leaders.  Finally, Professor Kirchmeier predicts that the Moratorium Movement is strong enough to continue to have lasting effects.

First, we relate growth in total factor productivity to accumulation of public capital. Second, we assess the role of public capital as an input to production. Third, we evaluate the reduction in costs that can be attributed to the presence of public infrastructure. Using regional data for Italy, we find that the aggregate impact of public capital is positive and significant under the first approach, slightly negative under the second, and virtually zero under the third. More coherent results obtain when disaggregating by geographical area and time period: under all three approaches, the effectiveness of public investment seems to be increasing over time and to be higher in Central and Southern regions than in Northern ones.

	",120.0,"One of the most influential ideas in the past 30 years is the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, the idea that market prices incorporate all information rationally and instantaneously. However, the emerging discipline of behavioral economics and finance has challenged this hypothesis, arguing that markets are not rational, but are driven by fear and greed instead. Recent research in the cognitive neurosciences suggests that these two perspectives are opposite sides of the same coin.  In this article I propose a new framework that reconciles market efficiency with behavioral alternatives by applying the principles of evolution - competition, adaptation, and natural selection - to financial interactions. By extending Herbert Simon's notion of ""satisficing"" with evolutionary dynamics, I argue that much of what behavioralists cite as counterexamples to economic rationality - loss aversion, overconfidence, overreaction, mental accounting, and other behavioral biases - are, in fact, consistent with an evolutionary model of individuals adapting to a changing environment via simple heuristics. Despite the qualitative nature of this new paradigm, the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis offers a number of surprisingly concrete implications for the practice of portfolio management.

The analysis is performed using a multivariate clustering algorithm not yet seen in the marketing literature that is able to handle data sets with unique (and numerous) spatial constraints.  This allows us to take into account physical impediments (such as the location of aisles and other inaccessible areas of the store) to ensure that we only deal with feasible paths.  We also recognize that time spent in the store plays an important role, leading to different cluster configurations for short, medium, and long trips.  The resulting three sets of clusters identify a total of 14 ""canonical path types"" that are typical of grocery store travel, and we carefully describe (and cross-validate) each set of clusters  These results dispel certain myths about shopper travel behavior that common intuition perpetuates, including behavior related to aisles, end-cap displays, and the ""racetrack.""

Most evidence indicates that shareholder activism can prompt small changes in target firms' governance structures, but has negligible impacts on share values and earnings.  To be sure, some empirical results are mixed.  But much of the disagreement among researchers reflects differences in the metrics emphasized.

Part II provides a theoretical framework for analyzing benefit taxes and user fees, defining these levies in contrast to general taxes, examining theoretical arguments for and against government reliance on benefit taxes and user fees, considering the appropriate role of benefit taxes and user fees as methods of government finance, and reviewing the manner in which these levies should be designed in order to achieve the purposes for which they are best suited. Part III considers benefit taxes and user fees in practice, surveying the extent to which governments rely on these levies in Ontario and other jurisdictions, and examining the current and potential application of benefit taxes and user fees to finance various categories of government expenditures.

Based on the Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed test is more powerful than the other three tests in limited samples. We then apply the test to examine the performance of mutual funds and hedge funds, and obtain some interesting results. We find that only eight mutual funds are found to beat the S&P 500 index, and only few hedge funds outperform the risk-free rate.

	",48.0,"This article explores the role of broadcast news media decisionmakers in shaping public understanding and debate of climate change risks. It locates the media within a ""tangled web"" of communication and debate between sources, media, and publics. The article draws on new qualitative research in the British context. The main body of it focuses on media source strategies, on climate change storytelling in news, and the ""myth of detachment"" sustained by many news decisionmakers. The empirical evidence, gathered between 1997 and 2004, is derived primarily from recordings and notes drawn from a series of seminars that has brought together equal numbers of BBC news and television decisionmakers and environment/development specialists. The seminars have created a rare space for extended dialogue between media and specialist perspectives on the communication of complex climate change science and policy. While the article acknowledges the distinctive nature of the BBC as a public sector broadcaster, the evidence confirms and extends current understanding of the career of climate change within the media more broadly. The working group discussions have explored issues arising out of how stories are sourced and, in the context of competitive and time-pressured newsrooms, shaped and presented in short news pieces. Particularly significant is the disjuncture between ways of talking about uncertainty within science and policy discourse and media constructions of objectivity, truth, and balance. The article concludes with a summary of developments in media culture, technology, and practice that are creating opportunities for enhanced public understanding and debate of climate change risks. It also indicates the need for science and policy communities to be more active critics and sources of news.

	",80.0,"This article argues for a cultural perspective to be brought to bear on studies of climate change risk perception. Developing the ""circuit of culture"" model, the article maintains that the producers and consumers of media texts are jointly engaged in dynamic, meaning-making activities that are context-specific and that change over time. A critical discourse analysis of climate change based on a database of newspaper reports from three U.K. broadsheet papers over the period 1985-2003 is presented. This empirical study identifies three distinct circuits of climate - change - 1985-1990, 1991-1996, 1997-2003 - which are characterized by different framings of risks associated with climate change. The article concludes that there is evidence of social learning as actors build on their experiences in relation to climate change science and policy making. Two important factors in shaping the U.K.'s broadsheet newspapers' discourse on 'dangerous' climate change emerge as the agency of top political figures and the dominant ideological standpoints in different newspapers.

	",55.0,"Assessing the social risks associated with climate change requires an understanding of how humans will respond because it affects how well societies will adapt. In the case of rapid or dangerous climate change, of particular interest is the potential for these responses to cross thresholds beyond which they become maladaptive. To explore the possibility of such thresholds, a series of climate change scenarios were presented to U.K. participants whose subjective responses were recorded via interviews and surveyed using Q methodology. The results indicate an initially adaptive response to climate warming followed by a shift to maladaptation as the magnitude of change increases. Beyond this threshold, trust in collective action and institutions was diminished, negatively impacting adaptive capacity. Climate cooling invoked a qualitatively different response, although this may be a product of individuals being primed for warming because it has dominated public discourse. The climate change scenarios used in this research are severe by climatological standards. In reality, the observed responses might occur at a lower rate of change. Whatever the case, analysis of subjectivity has revealed potential for maladaptive human responses, constituting a dangerous or rapid climate threshold within the social sphere.

	",57.0,"Human population health has always been central in the justification for sustainable development but nearly invisible in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations. Current scientific evidence indicates that climate change will contribute to the global burden of disease through increases in diarrhoeal disease, vector-borne disease, and malnutrition, and the health impacts of extreme weather and climate events. A few studies have estimated future potential health impacts of climate change but often generate little policy-relevant information. Robust estimates of future health impacts rely on robust projections of future disease patterns. The application of a standardized and established methodology has been developed to quantify the impact of climate change in relation to different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. All health risk assessments are necessarily biased toward conservative best-estimates of health effects that are easily measured. Global, regional, and national risk assessments can take no account of irreversibility, or plausible low-probability events with potentially very high burdens on human health. There is no ""safe limit"" of climate change with respect to health impacts as health systems in some regions do not adequately cope with the current climate variability. Current scientific methods cannot identify global threshold health effects in order for policymakers to regulate a ""tolerable"" amount of climate change. We argue for the need for more research to reduce the potential impacts of climate change on human health, including the development of improved methods for quantitative risk assessment. The large uncertainty about the future effects of climate change on human population health should be a reason to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and not a reason for inaction.

Press: Durham, 2005, Cleveland-Marshall Legal Studies Paper No. 05-111,  Available at SSRN: 
		
	",,"This article appears in an anthology of essays that consider the political thought of one of Europe's leading contemporary philosophers, Giorgio Agamben.  Agamben is not yet well-known in the Anglo-American legal academy, but this has been changing recently with the publication of a series of books (collectively titled Homo Sacer) that address, at a unified philosophical level, some of today's most pressing problems of sovereignty, law, and politics.    
In this essay I examine Agamben's political thinking by approaching it through the first-philosophical framework that underwrites it.  This examination takes the form of a critique of Agamben's critique of Jacques Derrida's critique of metaphysics.  Over the course of his career Agamben has consistently returned to his critique of Derrida as a point of departure for his own affirmative theses and this pattern holds true in Homo Sacer as well, justifying, I hope, this somewhat abstract point of entry into Agamben's political thought.  In a nutshell, my conclusion is that in his critique one finds two competing understandings of the nature of philosophical thinking, one (Agamben's) that gives priority to the question of ontology, and the other (Derrida's) that gives priority to the question of ethics, that is, of the relation to the other.    
Based on this analysis, I attempt to draw out the prescriptive consequences of this difference for the two thinkers' accounts of the political.  For Agamben, what follows is a rejection of legalism tout court in favor of a total transformation in social relations that dispenses with the form of law entirely.  Derrida's position, on the other hand, leads to a thoroughly (ethically) committed politics, one that accepts, however, both the legitimacy of the legal form and the appropriateness of incremental, reformist action in at least some political situations.   
Finally, in the concluding section I try to bring these abstractions down to earth by showing how they play out concretely in one area of law that provides an excellent test for Agamben's political theorizing, the United States Supreme Court's current constitutional limitations on capital punishment.

	",48.0,"The paper argues that the current ways of protecting intellectual property are limited in their scope for recognizing indigenous rights to indigenous knowledge. Indigenous knowledge is often defined as being holistic and collectively owned, and an appropriate protection should allow for maintaining the cultural and physical environment that has generated it.    
After examining the failure of the patent system to recognize indigenous input (using examples from the US Patent and Trademark Office), the analysis is directed towards alternatives. The world's first case of indigenous intellectual accreditation through the partnership between Mt Romance (Australian sandalwood company), Aveda (US-based multinational cosmetics corporation) and the Kutkabubba community (represented by the Songman Circle of Wisdom), is presented. The accreditation allows for the indigenous people to be recognized as traditional owners of the land, and for their care and knowledge about the sandalwood trees. It also gives them a share of the profits made from the contemporary use of the pure sandalwood oil.    
The paper argues that sustainability, and indigenous sustainability in particular, provides a conceptual framework for a change in the way of protecting intellectual property. This implies that appropriate policies should be put in place for businesses to feel responsible towards the community.

	",26.0,"Both chronic and transient poverty are reduced by greater command over physical capital, and life-cycle effects for the two types of poverty are similar. But there the similarities end. Most policies aimed at reducing chronic poverty may have little or no effect on transient poverty. Are the determinants of chronic and transient poverty different? Do policies that reduce transient poverty also reduce chronic poverty?    
Jalan and Ravallion decompose measures of household poverty into chronic and transient components and use censored conditional quantile estimators to investigate the household and geographic determinants of both chronic and transient poverty, taking panel data for post-reform rural China. They find that a household's average wealth holding is an important determinant for both transient and chronic poverty. Although household demographics, levels of education, and the health status of members of the household are important for chronic poverty, they are not significant determinants of transient poverty.    
Both chronic and transient poverty are reduced by greater command over physical capital, and life-cycle effects for the two types of poverty are similar. But there the similarities end. Smaller and better-educated households have less chronic poverty, but household size and level of education matters little for transient poverty. Living in an area where health and education are better reduces chronic poverty but appears to be irrelevant to transient poverty. Nor are higher foodgrain yields a significant determinant of transient poverty, although they are highly significant in reducing chronic poverty.    
These findings suggest that China's poor-area development program may be appropriate for reducing chronic poverty but is unlikely to help reduce variations in consumption that households typically face in poor areas - the exposure to uninsured income risk that underlies transient poverty will probably persist. Other policy instruments may be needed to deal with transient poverty, including seasonal public works, credit schemes, buffer stocks, and insurance options for the poor.

This helps us understand how alternative models are related, and lends support to the notion that endogenous dynamics and uncertainty matter, perhaps especially in monetary economies.

The recent decision to tighten the drinking water standard for arsenic from 50 parts per billion (ppb) to 10 ppb may therefore affect some households in rural communities, but may not directly reduce health risks for those on private wells. The article reports results from a survey conducted in a U.S. arsenic hot spot, the rural area of Churchill County, Nevada. This area has elevated levels of arsenic in groundwater. We find that a significant proportion of households on private wells are consuming drinking water with arsenic levels that pose a health risk. The decision to treat tap water for those on private wells in this area is modeled, and the predicted probability of treatment is used to help explain drinking water consumption. This probability represents behaviors relating to the household's perception of risk.

	",128.0,"In early 1979 Robert B. Cumming recognized the growing need for risk researchers and practitioners to publish their work in a dedicated professional journal. This led to the formation of an organization to support such a journal, with the Certificate of Incorporation for the Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) made official on August 28, 1980. The first issue of Risk Analysis: An International Journal appeared in March 1981. This article reviews the history of the SRA's first 25 years. It reviews the SRA's formation and growth, provides analyses of its major products (the journal, newsletter, conferences, and meetings), and discusses its impact. This article relies on published literature and a history of the SRA's first 20 years written by two of the authors. This history covers the SRA's many successes, which demonstrate the strength and vitality of the organization and provide optimism for its future. These successes include this journal, which published over 2,150 papers between March 1981 and this December 2005 issue. The successes also include its stable membership of approximately 2,000 members from 43 countries, well-attended annual meetings, and increasing support for true international growth as demonstrated by international risk forums like the World Congress on Risk held in Brussels in June 2003. Similarly, the history also covers the SRA's challenges and difficulties, with the recognition that these provide both an important context about the organization and the opportunity to learn from past experiences. These include the challenges associated with spin-off organizations that decreased the SRA membership in some disciplinary areas, notably in engineering and exposure assessment. This history also includes quantitative analyses of the contents of the first 25 years of Risk Analysis: An International Journal. The results show significant growth in the number of articles published each year, starting with approximately 30 articles published in the first few years to over 120 articles per year now. They also show a relatively even distribution of articles in the life, physical, and social sciences, which demonstrate the sustained commitment of the SRA and the journal to support interdisciplinary risk-related research. The SRA organizational structure currently includes two sections (SRA-Europe and SRA-Japan), 22 Chapters, and nine Specialty Groups, and the structure remains somewhat in flux. We present this history in five sections that cover major themes: (1) SRA formation, (2) membership and organization, (3) publications, (4) meetings, and (5) thematic issues. Like any organization of its size, the SRA boasts a long and diverse history, and no article can possibly capture it all. We hope that in documenting the first 25 years, we strengthen the SRA by providing some perspective on its roots and a rigorous quantitative analysis of some of its products.

	",36.0,"Use of similar or identical antibiotics in both human and veterinary medicine has come under increasing scrutiny by regulators concerned that bacteria resistant to animal antibiotics will infect people and resist treatment with similar human antibiotics, leading to excess illnesses and deaths. Scientists, regulators, and interest groups in the United States and Europe have urged bans on nontherapeutic and some therapeutic uses of animal antibiotics to protect human health. Many regulators and public health experts have also expressed dissatisfaction with the perceived limitations of quantitative risk assessment and have proposed alternative qualitative and judgmental approaches ranging from attributable fraction estimates to risk management recommendations based on the precautionary principle or on expert judgments about the importance of classes of compounds in human medicine. This article presents a more traditional quantitative risk assessment of the likely human health impacts of continuing versus withdrawing use of fluoroquinolones and macrolides in production of broiler chickens in the United States. An analytic framework is developed and applied to available data. It indicates that withdrawing animal antibiotics can cause far more human illness-days than it would prevent: the estimated human BENEFIT:RISK health ratio for human health impacts of continued animal antibiotic use exceeds 1,000:1 in many cases. This conclusion is driven by a hypothesized causal sequence in which withdrawing animal antibiotic use increases illnesses rates in animals, microbial loads in servings from the affected animals, and hence human health risks. This potentially important aspect of human health risk assessment for animal antibiotics has not previously been quantified.

	",78.0,"While the potential for intellectual property rights to inhibit the diffusion of scientific knowledge is at the heart of several contemporary policy debates, evidence for the %u201Canti-commons effect%u201D has been anecdotal. A central issue in this debate is how intellectual property rights over a given piece of knowledge affects the propensity of future researchers to build upon that knowledge in their own scientific research activities. This article frames this debate around the concept of dual knowledge, in which a single discovery may contribute to both scientific research and useful commercial applications. A key implication of dual knowledge is that it may be simultaneously instantiated as a scientific research article and as a patent. Such patent-paper pairs are at the heart of our empirical strategy. We exploit the fact that patents are granted with a substantial lag, often many years after the knowledge is initially disclosed through paper publication. The knowledge associated with a patent paper pair therefore diffuses within two distinct intellectual property environments %u2013 one associated with the pre-grant period and another after formal IP rights are granted.  Relative to the expected citation pattern for publications with a given quality level, anticommons theory predicts that the citation rate to a scientific publication should fall after formal IP rights associated with that publication are granted. Employing a differences-indifferences estimator for 169 patent-paper pairs (and including a control group of publications from the same journal for which no patent is granted), we find evidence for a modest anti-commons effect (the citation rate after the patent grant declines by between 9 and 17%). This decline becomes more pronounced with the number of years elapsed since the date of the patent grant, and is particularly salient for articles authored by researchers with public sector affiliations.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) and daily ethanol intake were explored in 1,100 Japanese salesmen.

The adjusted risk for hypertension (SBP e 140 mmHg or DBP e 90 mmHg) increased significantly when daily ethanol intake exceeded 60 g/day, and the categorical dose of interest was 60.190 g/day. The BMDL and BMD of ethanol intake for increased SBP and DBP were estimated to be approximately 60 and 75 g/day, respectively. These findings suggest that the BMDL and BMD correspond to the NOAEL and lowest-observed-adverse-effect level, respectively, if the sample number of clinical data is large enough to confirm the dose-response association.

	",,"As for most of its Caribbean neighbours, Trinidad and Tobago's leading cause of maternal morbidity is unsafe abortion. Yet activism to introduce public policy and legislation that effectively address this aspect of women's reproductive rights and health has been met with public outcry. With almost hysterical opposition coming from certain religious quarters, there is the unsubstantiated impression that Trinidadians are over-whelmingly opposed to abortion law reform. A national survey was therefore carried out of people's knowledge and views on the current abortion law in Trinidad and Tobago. The survey found that although almost half of respondents had an unfavourable perception of abortion, more than half of them were in favour of broadening the legal grounds for accessing terminations. Incest, rape and danger to a woman's life were cited as the most significant circumstances under which abortions should be permitted. The vast majority of respondents agreed that voting on abortion law reform by members of the legislature should not be based on personal beliefs. The findings demonstrate that there is not the degree of opposition to abortion law reform that is widely assumed. On the other hand, given the wide variance of views and perceptions, we argue that public health concerns and human rights should always trump public opinion.

	",188.0,"The constitution contains many disparate structural provisions and guarantees of individual rights: federalism questions under the commerce clause start in very different places from the protection of speech, religion or property. Yet the differences are often misleading. In each case the structure of the argument is identical: what is the basic interest that is protected, what justifications can be posed for its limitation, with or without compensation. Where an intermediate or strict standard of review is proposed, the nature of these inquiries all collapse to the single question of whether government intervention overcomes some market imperfection relating to negative externalities (force and fraud) or monopoly and coordination problems. Where the standard of review is reduced to rational basis, then the structure of basic rights and the justifications for their restriction becomes ill-formed and ad hoc. The conceptual defense of the Lochner era is much stronger on structural grounds than its manifold critics commonly suppose.

It begins by suggesting how one should think about the relation of neuroscience (or any other material explanation of human behavior) to criminal responsibility, distinguishing between internal and external critiques based on neuroscience.  It then describes the signs and symptoms of BOS, the essential feature of which is to make claims about the implications of neuroscience for criminal responsibility that cannot be conceptually or empirically sustained.  It then applies the diagnostic lens of BOS to the claims in Roper v. Simmons.  Finally, the article recommends Cognitive Jurotherapy [CJ] as the therapy of choice for BOS.

	",,"Until 1996, local telephone markets had been treated as natural monopolies and thus subject to regulation. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the ""Act"") seeks to introduce competition into these markets. One method the Act adopts to stimulate such competition is to mandate that incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) provide access to their unbundled network, such as loops and switches. In August of 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued its First Report and Order, which established a pricing rule for UNEs. The FCC's pricing rule sets the price for a UNE at its total element long-run incremental cost (TELRIC) plus a reasonable share of the incumbent LEC's forward-looking common costs. We propose a pricing methodology to implement that rule based on a combination of what we call the market-determined efficient component-pricing rule (M-ECPR) and competitively neutral end-user charges. We assert that using the M-ECPR to price UNE access is more faithful to the language and intent of the Act than is the approach adopted by the FCC. We also maintain that the FCC misunderstood the efficient component-pricing rule when the agency rejected it as a basis of pricing UNEs.    
After outlining our proposal for pricing UNEs, we argue that the FCC's pricing rule is problematic because it prevents the incumbent LEC from recovering its total costs by denying any recovery of the LEC's historical costs and ensuring that it will not fully recover its forward-looking costs. We then respond to criticisms of the M-ECPR by various economists and refute the assertions that the principal authors of the original efficient component-pricing rule rejected the M-ECPR in favor of TELRIC pricing for UNEs. We conclude by warning that the FCC's pricing rule would discourage investment in local telecommunications networks and may eventually drive LECs into bankruptcy.

	",118.0,"Under what conditions do stakeholders consent to a regime of corporate governance? We propose that consent by the governed in corporate governance cannot be satisfactorily explained without reference to the collective value of procedural fairness that underlies markets. Drawing on the social psychology of justice and the political economy of social choice, we highlight the critical role played by democratic procedures in achieving consent by the governed in modern society. This line of reasoning leads us to suggest that the evolution of corporate governance, too, can be understood in terms of Tocqueville's well-known hypothesis that democracy eventually prevails in all spheres of organised activity. Examining the historical record of institutional reform in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, we find that corporate governance has indeed evolved to make increasing use of democratic procedures. Viewed over the long-term of two centuries of capitalist development, corporate governance is seen to have successively incorporated enfranchisement, separation of powers and representation. In conclusion, we consider the implications of basing the study of corporate governance on the question of stakeholder consent and the practice of corporate governance on the procedures of democracy.
